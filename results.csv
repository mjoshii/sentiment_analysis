Operator,1,2022-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,72167700,"No training, then to the wolves you go  Only the pay was good. That's it.  Absolutely minimum training. Then if you make a mistake, even as a trainee, you're on the chopping block. Which is a lot of stress and adds to why they can't keep people and have constant mandatory overtime. Morale is at an all time low. Have you ever wondered what it's like to be harrassed because you're a woman? And then the harrasser still works there after turning it in because ""they're a good employee ""! Look no further, I have the place for you! Did I mention that if you snap back at your harrasser, YOU get a final warning? They leave your training up to you. Need to learn to drive a forklift? Up to you. If you dont get it done or are unsure, terminaton awaits you. New and unsure where to find items for stocking? People have eyes for a reason! Out you go! There's expectations and then there's just absolute overkill. It's so sad that it's almost comical. They tell you that your job is very important and not to make mistakes but you don't have the training needed to avoid these mistakes. Then you fall into the trap of getting fired for ""poor performance "" It's certainly hard to perform if you can't get any training for your job! If you say something about it, they'll say that they gave you the bits and pieces and now it's up to you to make your career! I'd say that expecting trainees to do a job perfectly without training is certainly ambitious! Did I say poor work life balance? 6 days a week. Some people hardly ever leave. Most people in that plant are stuck in the old ways of working until they drop dead. Advice to Management:Stop expecting people to train themselves and actually provide the basic training that's needed for the job you hire them for.

"Research Scientist in Decatur, IL",1,2022-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,68898481,"Do Not Work Here.  They pay you money for your work.  Attitudes everywhere, higher level scientists act like you're an ant and certain scientists look down on you just for being a contractor. They expect you to work like a hired-on scientist and help their research advance without giving you benefits or respect of being an ADM scientist. If you do only what your contracted to do- that's not enough. Be expected to give presentations and to give input at group meetings even if you barely know the experiment since you just started on it- as well as not even knowing how long they'll keep you around. Very weird expectations. I was working the small-scale fermentation team and was doing well, a sanitation specialist, who thinks he's a scientist there, lied about how I disposed of acid, something he asked me do and he was responsible of (and something outside of my contractual obligation) and they ended my contract immediately with no conversation with me about the situation. They went completely off of whatever this person said and ended my 8 month contract after 6 months. While I was there, I helped decrease the error bars found in their results, collect accurate data in a timely manner, some days I would be sampling 100% by myself while other scientists were at their desks or calling off of work, and TRAINED another contractor. All in 6 months. But apparently I was ""unsafe in the lab"" and that nullified all of that great work performance. But it was a blessing in disguise, while working there I found out they keep contractors on contract for 1-2+ years before hiring them in, that means you receive no benefits from ADM while working there and they dangle employment over your head like bait. One contractor was hired in as I became a contractor and she would occasionally joke about wanting to be fired to be re-hired as a contractor due to the high workload they dropped on her head each week. A higher scientist I worked with does so much each week and they wont promote him to a higher position because he's too good at what he does at that position and use the fact he doesn't have a Masters/PhD as an excuse. Not even a raise. He's been there for five years. The lab environment is messy, random liquids in random beakers unlabeled for days even YEARS (in a microbe lab?!). I would ask PhDs to clean up after themselves, these same scientists would ask me questions about instrument operation- I watched my supervisor yell at us about sampling errors and then when she did it ASKED ME how to sample! Scientists push you off of instruments you're working on or stare you down as you use it until you're done. The lab's ceiling tile is constantly under repair, by the time I left there was a weird tent-funnel system set up to catch liquid out of the roof due to tile replacement. It wasn't until my new lab position that I realized how unsafe and abnormal that actually was. Unless you really want to get into fermentation science, avoid working here. Decatur smells like feces somedays, trains are constantly stopping on tracks forcing you to find a way around. The workers there are very cliquey, I felt like I had a two-day window to be socially accepted or not (I was not), and obviously some are respected more than others. There are other labs and industries that dont have their nose so high up. It's sad to see one of the largest American companies in the world functions this way. Advice to Management:If there is an issue or a statement from one of your employees about a contractor, get both sides of the story. Don't just end the contract without any explanation from the contractor on why an employee may say what they did. Also, make it clear what the path of becoming a permanent employee entails- don't just keep saying ""you're doing great"" at each one-on-one and all of a sudden end their contract because of some janitor, basically.",0.43667503607503605,0.0516907647907648,positive

Unfortunately, that's where the positives stop.  I left of my own accord after 12 years. As an accountant, I saw the bonuses reaped from upper management while employee-focused social functions, bonuses, and even Christmas parties were cut. The company has begun outsourcing. I.T. was outsourced a few years ago. In 2021 and 2022, Accounting functions were outsourced. They claimed it wasn't outsourcing, but a strategic partner. However, that was not the case. Morale was low and many left. I was told I would lose my position in the coming year. It was literally that arbitrary. They couldn't give me a date or time period. In order to receive severance I had to stay on board to train my overseas replacement and as long as I was needed. I did not stick around. Management often forms their reviews to alott only certain high marks to limit the number of ""higher raises"" given out each year at review time. I worked two jobs and kept both desks afloat for months until I could train and supervise a new hire. I was given a poor review with no mention of my extended duties beyond my job. I was also given supervisory duties over two employees which I held for 2 years. I could not be given the title, however, because a pay bump wasn't approved. This happened to another person in my group, also. I performed the work of a supervisor without the title or pay. Bottom line, ADM only cares about margins.

Management is erratic and inattentive. Workers toil in unbearable heat without relief. Staffing shortages compounded by a hiring process that moves slower than a geological age, make it impossible to maintain any adequate safety or quality standards. Management is more concerned with hiding unsanitary manufacturing conditions from customers than they are with cleaning. Documentation is routinely falsified.

Many were smart, ambitious, and fun to be around. If you like working with your hands and a small town, this may be worth considering.  I worked in the East Plant as a process engineer. I had thought I would be engineering, but I constantly had to move into supervising for months at a time on the back shifts with less than 1 days notice sometimes. My projects would be moved to others or put on pause. It was extremely frustrating to have to do this roughly about 4 times in the 3 years I was there. Another aspect that I did not like was the environment. It was dirty, hot, and quite miserable with the company constantly being very cheap and giving minimal raises. It is manufacturing so that is to be expected to some degree but there are many opportunities in cleaner and safer manufacturing plants. The pay was also quite terrible. Raises were around 2% every year with no bonuses or stock options available. They ran very bare bones so you often carried many hats but that does give good experience. It just isn't something you would probably want to do for 30 years. In my experience at the East Plant, it was often a rat race to see who could work the hardest and spend the most time in the plant as if that were something to be proud of. You can definitely get a role with decent work/life balance but don't be surprised if the role ends up sucking up all your time.

My review is specifically for being hired into Procurement. Developing structured approach to procurement. Flexible with remote work. Taking COVID-19 seriously. As a contractor, they do not want to approve overtime, so you can count on 8-hour days - great for work/life balance.  As a company, ADM is taking substantial strides to improve the organization. My review is specifically for being hired into Procurement. Within my first 30 days of working, I was told the position I was hired into has no chance of converting to an actual hired position, so 1 star for Career Opportunities. == Culture is very toxic == A 'work HARDER not smarter' attitude pervades the culture. I was directly told that if I have time to recommend improvements then I am not busy enough. In our recent all-hands, our Director suggested that 80+ hour work-week is approximately when people should begin asking for professional development. This is a culture where you will never enjoy a job well done. Our team stopped reporting being ahead of schedule because when we do management raises the standards for all future projects. Asking questions is discouraged - questions are seen as your ignorance (which reflects on your supervisor). Be prepared to justify why you need access to any information your supervisor didn't anticipate you needing. Poor communication is the norm. Being able to shut people down (""You don't need to know that"") and scheduling multiple conflicting meetings seems to be a status symbol. Meeting Hygiene is wasteful. Management routinely schedules conflicting meetings and never updates their RSVP. Usually about 10 minutes after the meeting was supposed to start the manager notifies us they are rescheduling the meeting. We wait for that message because the wrath of a manager is worth just sitting there. About 1 in 5 meetings will always run over time. If the meeting agenda is achieved early, the meeting leader will want to fill the time with unplanned discussion. You can usually be on mute for an entire meeting since they generally are people coordinating information they could have emailed. Matrix-style organization with ineffective delegation of decision authority. does not effectively delegate, so you spend 60%+ of your time waiting for people to have the time to make a decision they already feel is beneath them. Advice to Management:Teams do not understand the resources they are being asked to use. Everyone speaks in platitudes because they do not understand the operational definition of processes. This is multiplying everyone's work time-work is constantly sent back for revision because ""a real high level overview"" means something different at every level of the organization. People are scared to commit to anything because they know that tremendous resources are being spent to BLAME people while hard work gets ""rewarded"" with more hard work. Delegate decision authority to the lowest possible level. You won't be in control of every decision, and that is good. You have the tools to make sure everyone is on track.",0.42511396011396,0.03207977207977207,positive

The heath care package is poor 1million life time cap and if your heathy you will pay all of your heath care costs and typically not meet your deductible. This is by design. The management has 0 accountability , their slogan for safety is zero is possible. but should be zero is probable as anything that may occur will be blamed on the effected employee 100% of the time regardless of any circumstance. This is also by design and the reason for their belief in zero is possible , zero liability as their goal. I believe their primary concern is not the safety of the employees as much as it is to cover their liability in any situation regardless of anything else. I worked for ADM for 23 years as a maintenance A my job was to help maintain the electrical maintenance troubleshoot electrical problems and support of primarily electrical based problems in the plant. I received my Journeymans and Master electricians license while I worked there. but this company does not have electricians on staff thus my maintenance A job description. They do this so the can pay the employees less than electrician standard wages and still have them do electrical work. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I finally got fed up and left it was not hard to find a company to top what this one offered.

"Engineer II in Decatur, IL",2,2016-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,12499294,"Free Money, but No Inspiration Available  Literally the easiest money you'll make. Put in 50+ hours per week and produce nothing of value and you will never lose your job. Do the same and produce then get moved up until you are one step ahead of your capabilities. Put in 50+ hours in that position, etc etc etc.  Everyone is promoted on an arbitrary basis. The pro listed above creates a considerable con - everybody is bad at their job because they are promoted based on their performance at their current job, NOT because of their potential at the job they get promoted to. Hard working engineers who are willing to put in crazy hours and forego life outside of the plant are rewarded with higher positions but make terrible managers who expect equivalent effort from their subordinates who don't have the same values. Good, productive engineers are left behind because they don't work the hours, while less than capable engineers get moved up because they are at work before their managers get to work and after their managers leave. The review system is unproductive because it is based on the amount of work done not the quality of work or the employee's ability to work with team members. There is no structured system for Engineers to move up in pay scale. There is no definition for Production Engineer, Engineer I, Engineer II, Engineer III, and Senior Engineer and these titles are arbitrarily distributed. You won't get the title unless you request it. They don't offer promotions. Really there is no inspiration to work for ADM and the longer you stay the less motivated you will be to advance. Advice to Management:Management's ability to retain talent is less than stellar. Of the 20 engineers that I started with 9 years ago 1 remains with the company. That is not an exaggeration. Management needs to stop asking 'why do we lose engineers' and start putting in the initiative and research to actually understand why. Their solution is to hire new graduates with a lucrative starting salary then squeeze every penny out of them without offering anything in return. It is a distorted way of running a business in the contemporary job landscape and unless they turn 180 degrees they will continue to bleed young talent. On a positive note, though, I think Juan Luciano is a great leader.

Once you are hired on officially, rather than through a contract employer, they have a good health care package. Will contribute to a 401K There is regular overtime pay.  It's a very rough schedule to live on. Swing shifts of 12 hours, switching from day shift to night shift every 2 weeks. The days off you do have are often determined to be on call and possible overtime shifts, but without compensation. So although you will technically have days off, you would not be able to leave town or make definitive plans in town. If you get called in and exceed 40 hours for the week, you would get overtime pay, but no pay for making yourself available even when not needed. This schedule makes it difficult to have relationships outside of work. It is a rough place to work, both environment and people. Officially harassment of any kind is not tolerated, but truly, you need to have very thick skin to be able to be there. Being the best you can be at your job isn't necessarily what the supervisors appreciate. Working hard, safely, maintaining a clean area, and being ahead of the rest of the pack when it comes to data reporting is not respected and some of (not all) the supervisors will trash talk good workers in front of other employees.

There is no need to speak condescendingly to employees. Often, you only speak to us if you believe we have done something wrong. I feel that i should state that the plant manager always makes an effort to say hello and ask how we are doing.

"Anonymous Employee in Decatur, IL",1,2016-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,10392248,"CFO Group  Note: This review is only relevant for positions within the CFO Group (Finance, accounting, internal audit & IT). ADM is a stable company and one of the top ag companies in the world. In finance and accounting, the work/life balance is manageable, and most departments are laid back. There are summer hours, and a few employee appreciation events throughout the year. In addition, the company is very stable- while the industry doesnt have much of an upside, it has even less of a downside; everyone needs food. The commercial group (not part of CFO group) is considered amongst the best in the world for grain merchandising.  The ag-industry is slow growing, has tiny margins, and doesnt really change, hence ADM lacks a dynamic atmosphere, and more resembles an inefficient government bureaucracy. When you also consider that most CFO-group jobs are in Decatur, Il (a polluted, rundown industrial town), this leads to several negative factors: -Minimal career development. They dont develop their own employees, so most senior-level employees are recruited from competitors who DO develop employees. -Low pay. Only top managers are eligible for any form of bonus. Salary is known to be far below industry standard. -Ancient IT systems, think 1980s DOS system. Seriously. ADM isnt Apple. -Brain-drain/less qualified employees. No qualified person really wants to live in Decatur. The 'leftovers' are more focused their multiple out of wedlock children and the Kardashians. -Nepotism. Its amazing how many people have a relative that were helped. Many many people have the same last names, and not by coincidence. Simply put, the CFO group is not for intelligent, hardworking and career-minded individuals. To further attest to ADMs status, there have been several recent high profile departures, including the head of IT, while in the middle of a huge IT transformation project. The C-suite routinely brags about its high-margin acquisition strategy, but no tiny bolt-on purchase will really ad that much value when compared to ADMs behemoth corn/oilseeds/grain divisions. The CFO group at ADM is a place to go for a job, for a paycheck. If you are ambitious, or want at least moderate career development, AVOID any finance/accounting job at ADM. If you are interested in a merchandising role, then ADM is definitely the right place. Advice to Management:While it is hard to change the company given the low-margin, slow growth industry, at least focus on employee development for those employees that want to make a difference.",0.4144365079365077,0.1431735209235209,positive

Merrit Constructors  You can learn every area and classification you will need anywhere here in all fields. As an Electrician, (Construction & Maintenance), I have worked in non explosive, highly explosive & very corrosive areas throughout the plant. ADM is a very Safety Oriented Company that strives to continuously improve and educate all employees Contractors included.This is by a high standard of accountability to the company and for ones self by taking the time for employees to become aware of hazards in the areas they are working in. All of this is to ensure everyone goes home safely at the end of the day to their families and loved ones. They are also doing an amazing job with all the new construction over the years to make working conditions cleaner & safer for everyone whether an employee, visitor or a client. House Keeping is at the top of the list as well. Every job I have ever worked at since working at ADM I can say without hesitation I carried & carry all I have learned from ADM to all of them and all past employers and present are grateful to you. I would like to personally Thank Ron Wilson for making me do nothing but put parts away for my first 3 weeks, and telling me that in life the one thing No One can ever take from you is knowledge and knowledge becomes Wisdom only when you use it so remain teachable. Also that one learns even more when he is willing to teach others. Thanks ADM for all you taught me!!!!  Cons there are not to many except for your belief in Zero accidents. I believe 98 maybe 99% of all accidents can be prevented and that most are human error. Unfortunately things do break and what can happen will happen. I have seen people targeted after an incident that wasn't even a lost time accident and fired just afterwards for something not related supposedly. It has the reputation now so people are afraid to report anything because they know what will come next. I have never had to sign a paper anywhere that I have ever worked that stated I could not hold them liable if an accident occurred and if I did not sign it I would not be hired. Though I know the ADM is 100 % safer than when I first worked there that does not give me confidence that this is a safe place to work at. I think accountability by deniability shows a lack of integrity. Myself I personally think that anyone who deals with workmans comp is in for a world of hurt for they care nothing for the victim whether one seeks legal action or not. If one does seek legal action beware because it will follow that individual. If one is careful and follows your instructions to the T and are self-disciplined to consciously be aware of where they are, identifying thoroughly on safety sheets all existing hazards in that area & appropriate course of action to removing hazards or appropriate PPE while focused to job at hand, their odds of going home without incident is a strong 99%. Safety is a team effort so strive for perfection but be realistic that 1 to 2 % cannot be prevented. I am sorry but the smell isn't all that pleasant but I did get use to it.

ADM uses very old practices and has an older management mentality. It is very hierarchical. An outsider would also be surprised as some of the basic policies that this MNC does not have. The salaries are not as high as they should be across the board. I feel that they take advantage of local people from the central Illinois area in providing these lower salaries. In addition, it is troubling to see the company move its headquarters to Chicago from Decatur. I understand to an extent the business reasons for doing this, but I am concerned that this will severely damage an already fragile economy. Decatur was the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article describing the serious challenges. It just feels like ADM is leaving its roots and sacrificing the people of Decatur in the process. Advice to Management:Consider easing up on the intense hierarchy and look at new ideas and options. Just because you have not done it before does not mean that it would not benefit the company and its employees in the long run. Also, take a more sincere approach to environmental protection. Everyone has to complete a training on environmental stewardship, but I think this is only because it was mandated by the government due to the company's many environmental violations. ADM has a big role to play in these issues and should understand the consequences of failing to protect our natural resources.

The other con is hours, and I mean the sense that if it's dead in the office, you're still expected to stick around. With technology today, much of your job can be done outside of the office.

Good 401k investment options.  Upper level management has literally no regard or respect for the workers, and is shameless in demonstrating their disdain. Sounds extreme, but it truly borders on sociopathic. Workers cafeteria has elementary school style and size lunch tables. When complaints were lodged, response from plant superintendent was that they didn't want you in there for long, so they're not going to make it comfortable. Management cafe is another story, however. Reward for hitting a safety goal in most places may be a sweatshirt or coffee mug... we once got a candy cane and a packet of hot cocoa mix, because it was near the holidays. Employee drops unconscious in the entry hallway, is forced to leave via ambulance...and then is charged a day on his attendance record for leaving. Working environment is 120°F or more in much of the plant. Work schedule is impossible to live your life around. Full production scheduled on major holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas, all while equipment sat idle for weeks prior. And unless you have an engineering degree (brains optional), don't even bother suggesting an improvement to the process. If it ever gets implemented at all, it will only be months or years after your suggestion, and after an engineer has reintroduced the idea as his own and taken credit for it.

ADM is massive, and you will have no say in where your placement will be. I was 20 hours from home so I was incredibly home sick and started counting down until I left the moment I got there. My manager didn't allow me to get as much overtime as I could have. You need to take your own vehicle to location, so this will add a lot of miles. IF hired full-time a Merchandiser has SOME say in the region they would like to work, but I know people who were placed 30 hours from home, 8, 12, or 3. Not many close though. (*I was highly recommended for full-time employment but took better offer from company closer to home.) IF you don't have many strong ties to home and love to get a change of scenery every 2-3 years than this is an AWESOME company. They have great benefits, and you meet interesting people. I just needed to be back in a metropolis. I was glad I did this because it really reassured that. Advice to Management:Interns know how mundane and unimportant they are, but ask if they have a regional preference. I know it can't be minutes from home but a few hour drive is better than 20+ hours. Or possibly provide interns who work over 10 hours from home with a plane ticket voucher to fly home sometime in July.",0.5776256613756614,0.23055886243386248,positive

They give the chance to take initiatives whatever the position. Wide variety of businesses and processes Strong organization  The managers are changing very often of positions and as the culture is to consider that changes are providing always added value, I had several managers with very low experience in their position. and therefore their capacity to bring technical support to their subordinates is rather poor. The way you are perceived in your job can change very quickly from positive to negative in particular if you don't show strong motivation to move to another position after 3-4 years. The worst can be as in my case to be considered as not anymore valuable because of too much time spent in the position. The acknowledge of my technical competencies by my managers was rather low while in the same time the job was obviously very correctly done. Here the question of the matching between the culture of the company and myself was the reason raised to justify that from their side !

Every year perks and benefits get taken away from us. There is a lack of transparent communication and vision from execs/management/supervisors. Lack of accountability for underperforming employees or supervisors who bully, they just get ""coached"" to do better. Need 7 layers of approval to do ANYTHING! We are currently not even allowed to spend $1 without getting a VP approval! The company says they pay for performance but there are only so many ""exceeds expectations"" they are allowed to give out on annual reviews, so even if a person is over performing they will get the same performance review rating as someone who comes to work and does the bare minimum of their job. No clear path for promotions and everything is dependant on how your supervisor feels about you personally and not how you actually perform your job. Advice to Management:be transparent and communicate. work on company culture and improving morale! Instead of all of these lay offs, perhaps 3M execs should take some responsibility for their actions for lack of success and take a pay cut to cut costs - just like the CEO of zoom. Stop with the private jets and first class - execs should have to fly coach just like the rest of us peons are made to do. cut out middle management bloat instead of laying off the employees that are ""in the trenches"". Go back to Mcknight principles and hire good people and leave them alone, instead of micromanaging everything that employees do. bring back the 1-5 grading system for employee reviews so that it is actually possible to get a better than ""does your job"" - OR how about not putting quotas on how many exceeds expectations you are allowed to give out and actually give them out when deserved and not just when someone is looking to get a promotion. I hope that with spinco/parentco that we will re-imagine and refocus what 3M is and will be for the better, but I doubt it with the way everything is getting communicated (or lack there-of).",0.4466836734693877,0.12399376417233558,positive

Good team-mates, I have made life-long friendships from this role. Really cutting edge work being done in factories. Easy job for sales - just sell the quality products the parent organisation in the US delivers.  I spent over 4 years working at 3M. I was hired as a software graduate but the company didn't seem to know how to turn a graduate into a software programmer. I had major impostor syndrome and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find a job anywhere else. I found my time there to be a truly spirit crushing experience. I worked on a variety of projects, many experimental. I had the experience of attending meetings with people who knew a project was due to be scrapped and would lie to you about it (to this day, I still don't understand why). Consequence was that I would continue to work on something pointless instead of re-directing my time elsewhere. Various cost-cutting measures introduced with false economies. I found that I suddenly had to do random administrative tasks that had previously been handled by a corporate team. My requests for help from that team were rebuffed (no performance appraisal benefit in them helping me). General technical incompetence. I witnessed a middle manager overseeing a team of well paid engineers ask why the data in a relational database couldn't all be stored in one table. Corporate IT asked me to share my password with them in order to fix something on my computer. An ideal environment for corporate psychopaths and self promoters. In my first week I attended a presentation by senior employees about career management. The advice was ""manage your manager"". This turned out to be true. People who spent time promoting themselves to their managers seemed to do a lot better than those who just kept their heads down, worked hard and delivered results. I saw a beautiful house of cards get built, the builder promote someone else into looking after it before taking the credit and moving on, leaving a live hand grenade behind. Parent company in the US seemed to keep appointing a new MD. Depending on what the current numbers were like the corporate strategy alternated between ""get rid of people to get costs down"" and ""boost R&amp;D spending to increase the share of revenue coming from new products"". After a round of redundancies where mid-level technical staff were let go because ""R&amp;D efforts weren't in line with corporate strategy"" but none of the technical leaders were let go, despite ""wasting"" resource on the very same thing, I decided to deal with my anxiety and just leave. Advice to Management:This is a tricky one - the real corporate masters are in the US. The injustices I saw in the work appraisal process were the biggest problem for me. I would challenge management right across the organisation to actually observe what their reports are doing and try to measure value objectively.

"Information Technology in Saint Paul, MN",3,2023-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,72432140,"Career Setback - Island of the Lotus Eaters  To be honest, the employee benefits are the best I have seen in all my various careers. 3M offers an employee store where you can purchase 3M products at production cost. Excellent salary. 3M really stepped up during COVID by sending all employees a COVID care package which included cloth masks (10), anti-bacterial sanitizer, and a zero-touch door opening tool. Zero on-call responsibility. The offerings for people that were affected by the (still ongoing) reduction in force (RIF) were better than I have seen elsewhere. Everything from coaching, expert consultants, access to job fairs, etc. It was by far the most well executed and organized RIF - maybe this is a negative?  I have never seen a company spend so much time, effort, and money on all the stuff they physically mail. All of the content was simply, look how awesome everything is at 3M; you are valued and had zero value other than to the people who were picked to pose in the articles. God help you if you want to make positive change. It is like the mob - they will whack you, your family, and your pets. You are good if you are okay with the this is the way weve always done it mentality. By far the most political environment in which I have ever worked. Everything is a favor and not just do your job. 3M is way too big for an individual contributor to matter. Everyone starts out shiny, hopeful, and wanting to help out your fellow 3Mrs but after a few months that all changes to frustration, anger, and despair. You are, quite literally, an employee number, an expense, and a line item on a spreadsheet. If you think you matter, I promise you that you do not. If you think you are part of a larger purpose or mission, I promise you that you are not. If you think your contributions have made a difference, I promise you that someone else took the credit for it instead of you (but you will never know). Management would let people go and you wouldnt find out until you attempted to reach out to them and never got a response. When you finally get fed up with the lack of response and reach out to their manager, you are finally told that they are no longer with the company. When asked who their replacement is for XYZ function you are told that there is no one and there will be no backfill because there is a constant hiring freeze. Huh? I had absolutely zero 3M-funded training during employment. Whenever management was asked about funds for XYZ training, employees were given the runaround and eventually would stop asking altogether. For the first time in my IT career, I paid for my own training, event fees, and certification costs. This is a standard benefit afforded to almost any IT professional by a company (unless you work at 3M). I saved this for last. If you feel that this is inaccurate, please read some news articles before considering employment. Google 13-million-3m-earplug-verdict to get a nicely summarized summary. Shady business practices and tactics. 3M touted itself as a company based on ethics - I am sure that ethics exist somewhere at 3M but I dont consider screwing veterans and other responders out of settlement money by splitting a company into two, where one is profitable (new healthcare company) and the other not so profitable (PostIt notes, Meguiars, Nexcare, and everything else) with the intent to bankrupt the legacy 3M hoping to subvert paying what is rightfully owed. Additionally, I dont think it was very ethical to invoke a huge reduction in force (which is still on-going) just a day or two after the judge called BS on that plan. After the reduction in force was enacted, and then applying for jobs, I quickly realized that my time at 3M had actually crippled my career because everything was so massively siloed that you didnt have the ability to grow much less get anything done effectively or in a timely manner; but you stayed because the pay is awesome and benefits were great. You lose a bit of your soul in exchange for benefits, pay, and flexibility; believe me, it isnt worth it to put the 3M name on your resume. The severance pay was definitely not commensurate with the tenure, effort, contributions, blood, sweat, and tears spent. I am sure this review will be buried by an over-abundance of false everything is great and Mike Roman cares and his employees love him type propaganda but I hope it helps just one potential candidate. 3M sickens me and I am ashamed that I was proud to work there. In fact, I purposely do not buy their products even if I perceive their product as better. Advice to Management:Not enough time in a day to write anything here because it would have zero impact for change. Perhaps the shareholders will listen to their employees' feedback after they are forced to pay out. Nothing makes people pay attention and listen more than when you mess with their investment portfolio.",0.5161371527777779,0.2037547348484849,positive

They are indeed trying to transform and improve the workplace but results are slow and low.  - Below average benefits compared to other same size US companies. Better don't fall sick when working here. Non existent dependent insurance - everything needs to be paid to have a small amount of coverage. - Annual increment % one of the lowest I have ever seen for SG mnc. HR not fully honest when recruiting. Bonus % by rank is also low. - Too many old people who have worked for 15-30 years at the company at really high rank but with super old mindset. - Managers that does not know anything but have a very high rank due to tenure at the company. - Too many people who does not do what they are supposed to do, and somehow let off the hook whenever mistakes happen. Escalations are not taken seriously. - No team building/meal budget or any remote working compensation. - Office location super inconvenient if you need to go in to office. - No transparency in reward/job promotion. Not like other companies, you will not know what job grade/rank others are at because job title seems to be completely misleading and random for some jobs. This is probably to cover up the fact that a lot of long tenured folks are already at very high rank and not doing what they are supposed to do at that level. This is something that really needs to be looked into by HR I believe. You cannot improve your employees if there is no transparency as to how to move to the next level or progress. Good people will always leave while people who are looking to retire will stay and be stagnant. - Their motto is hire to retire - which explains my point above. I have never seen so many lazy people in one company, and they are all here. - Everything takes really slow to implement. Deadlines are never taken seriously and constantly postponed. Advice to Management:Leaders should talk to HR and think about how to retain employees who are actually working. Focus on improving your benefits to attract talent.

People generally are more collaborative than competitive. Theoretically you can grow to high levels (and pay) without having to be a manager of people. A stronger than average culture of listening to ideas and empowering people to do improvements themselves.  A lot of radical changes are taking place too fast. In general most of the changes make sense in strategical terms, but there is the feeling the company is rushing to get them done, and then new changes come that conflict with changes that haven't finalized. There have been restructuring measures essentially once a year over the last 5 years, all of them obeying to distinct strategies and situations and impacting different areas of the company, but overall sentiment from people I know is that there is no longer any sense that your job is secure. Many of these changes are announced with so little detail that people can't even start to understand them; this feels like lack of transparency and that leaders would rather not let employees know what is happening to have them under their control.

Same people being pushed around into different positions on a regular basis. - Continual fear of loosing your job through thousands of job cuts over 2 - 3 years. - Terrible recruitment strategies and non-existent retention strategies. - Zero team building or company organised social activities. Not even remote events during COVID. - Zero ongoing professional development. - Despite being told of great career opportunities, these do not exist. - Terrible work culture and expectation to work grossly extended hours and over weekends and public holidays with no appetite from management to fix this. - Culture elements such as 'customer at the core' are simply ignored in day to day business. - Over complicated and bureaucratic processes which prevent the company from being responsive to customer and industry needs. - Many staff who simply will not do their assigned job functions and Managers that do nothing to resolve this. - Focus is on share price and nothing else. - Innovation is dead. The company now just acquires technology and companies to broaden its portfolios. - Employee time is wasted on unnecessary administrative tasks that appease leadership and hinder people's ability to sell. - Zero performance feedback and prolonged periods of zero interaction with Manager. - Sales staff feel like they are disposable assets. - Management that values sales performance and personal friendships ahead of objective investigation and management of individuals who bully other employees and perpetuate a toxic work culture. - Many other reasons why working for this company was the worst mistake of my life. Advice to Management:After 3 years of restructuring there has been no discernible improvement in your profitability. Across the world, employees say the same things behind closed doors about working at 3M, too afraid to voice it to leaders: ""3M used to be the best company in the world to work for, it is now a sinking ship and the talent is jumping off as quick as they can."" You talk the talk and say things like speaking up and voicing opinion will not be punished and yet so many employees are unhappy and unwilling to speak up. Ask yourselves why this is. If you want to attract and retain good people, you need to change many leaders, stop shifting the same 10+ years leaders around and secure new ones, be competitive in your recruitment, have retention plans, structure the company in a much more simplified and efficient way and most importantly terminate the people perpetuating a toxic work culture.",0.48360744194077526,0.013448973865640531,positive

Most people would prefer to be in an urban/suburban area. In addition, the rural sites seem to get less attention and are neglected. 2)3M has went through restructuring around the time of the pandemic (2021) and has reduced headcount to a point where each role now has about 1.25 - 2 times the amount of work. In addition, there are so few people that there is not really an established on call system or back up system. 3) 3M Optimized Operations (rotational program) is a scam. This rotational program is advertised as an opportunity to work on projects and get experience at various 3M sites. In reality, this program is used as a tool to hire engineers for job req's that are not being filled (less desirable locations for instance). Advice to Management:1) Please hire more people to adequately staff manufacturing sites and stop paying attention to the finances 2) Please stop neglecting the 3M rural sites and give them the attention they need - invest in modernized office/production areas 3) 3M would be much more efficient if there were less manufacturing sites (10 or so) in the US.

I worked with many departments and moved to worked under different teams within this 4 years, all of my supervisors are super supportive, motivating and always provided feedback for improvement. People here are very respectful and have good attitude at work. I can say that company is lucky to have greatest employees who make a good working environment. - opportunity: As it is Global company, you will have opportunities to work with people from many countries. My recent team members are from different 5 countries, I can learned a lot from them. This is a good experience. - Ethics and Compliance: This company have a solid policy about compliance (at least in my local office), I did not face any of issues in my offices life.  - Career path : It s hard to see your career path here especially in support function. My last role before resignation already transfer to GSC (Global Service Center), they did not hire new worker to replace me, that make me feel like if I still work here, I need to move to other functions over and over to find secure place that GSC cannot replacing me. - Globalization model : Not only work processing and policy but including organization structure. I was separated from local team and changed to under Asia team with just 1 week notice. I cannot help feel isolated and not enjoy working as a team like before. - System : Too many systems to work with just for one tasks, each systems are not sync and process owner is from different departments, so you need to work on many steps and contact many person to just completed 1 tasks. Everytimes, they tried to change process flow and make an excuse that to reduce local tasks, they just make the flow more complicated and local have more admin tasks to work. - Work load: If you think 3M is a big company, so it must have many people work for each scope, you might disappointed. Its really hard to request more headcount. Work overtime is a required, even company try to value work life balance but the work cant be done easily especially in this year which many countries are preparing to transform to SAP. - Reorganization, mental support : Company has rapidly changed. Some departments were terminated from reorganization and many employees were unhired to maintain companys profit number statistics. Mental support should process by local team, mental issues is somehow globalized but actually it more sensitive and complex (most of them related with culture, situation of each country) and make sure to have psychologys expert to support mental issues not just hire people who dont have psychology background to work for this area. Advice to Management:Make sure to listen to negative feedback and think carefully about the dimensions, I feel burn out because of irrational and messy changed.

The amount of info they want you to put in salesforce takes about 70% of your time. taking away from valuable sales time. this leads to an incredible amount of lying about actual activities and sales won-which will help you get promoted with no backfire. You may either have a HUGE territory or a only a couple counties. depends on which territory you get. If you have an entire state, be prepared to drive all the time, AND spend hours on Salesforce.com once you get home. Leadership continues to create more homework on Salesforce in order to micro manage but explains it in a way to hide the fact that they are micromanaging you. There is a terrible culture where leadership never wants to hear any bad news or criticism about management. they promote those that worship their feet, without any thought about experience or ability to do the job. 3M has increased its price to its customers 4 times within the past year while only giving a 2% raise to sales reps that hit quota last year. Many reps have left recently because they know they can get better pay and have some sense of self respect. Advice to Management:-lay off your sales reps, and allow them to work how they see fit. judge them at the end of the year not every month. -You can't understand what your reps do daily by forcing them to log every little thing in Salesforce. - Understand that many reps are leaving and many are unhappy, and a minimal pay increase is a huge slap in the face",0.5212365591397848,0.14717741935483877,positive

USAC is a new restructuring where the US eliminated resourcing for Canada and killed its high performing culture. As a result all the good talent left. Zero local upward mobility and stagnant wages. US has this astonishing combination of useless meetings and endless spinning of tires for approvals to do anything, but at the same time offering no support or real care for the Canadian business. Competitors in Canada are starting to eat 3M alive because of the lack of focus locally. Its really too bad because before this restructure it was a different company. Sales professionals look elsewhere, there are better opportunities as there is zero incentive to outperform anymore. Advice to Management:Canadian managers were always supportive and fantastic, bright individuals. Unfortunately most of them left in the last 2 years for greener pastures.

Marketing Executive,2,2022-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,62529688,"Marketers - avoid at all costs  Good company welfare and good culture. Peer Recognition system is good. Many training courses/sessions to attend. Strong engineering company.  Poor leadership and poor execution. Current marketing setup doesnt make sense as marketing team doesnt have any say in campaigns at all. Budgets + strategy are determined by business and marketing leads are really project/campaign managers to ensure campaigns get launched. No opportunity for any inputs/value adds because thats how the setup is intended to be. Marketing skills needed is minimal since the role is like a middle man of sorts. More importantly, leadership of marketing at regional level needs to be reviewed. Under the new org, new management doesnt really care about marketing, seems like their lowest priority amidst other issues. Upper Leadership doesnt care (or maybe doesnt know/unaware of issues), middle level managers always have many reasons/excuses for why things are the way it is. Hence not much change going around, all talk but no action and this is very disappointing &amp; frustrating for marketers. No one is held accountable for poor campaign performance/execution in the org sadly. Inputs given from ground level usually falls on dead ears or not acted upon - shoes that management is doing things for the sake of doing but not genuine at all. Company is also very Process oriented and not agile to market. Will not recommend any marketers to join unless you would like to be a project manager. Advice to Management:Look at external hires more please. Companys culture is so ridden with so many veterans that it makes 3M slow to market and less agile to customer needs. You need more external perspective. And please review middle management competence as there is minimal accountability. Current marketing system is not set up for success.",0.43590909090909086,0.06707892882311486,positive

Service Desk Analyst in Heredia,2,2022-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,61434025,"Micromanagement is their thinking to be successful  Benefits: Transportation. WFH. Food subsidy. Learning Courses. Solidarity Association: ASO3M. Parking.  Micromanagement is incredible. Bootlickers. Favoritism. No feedback when being rejected when applying internally. They will always prefer quantity over quality, even if you are doing an excellent job but not getting their numbers, it does not matter you will be a bad employee. When applying to a different position/role, your manager will influence to affect you if they want you to move or not (in case they need you on the department you are or, if they just does not want you to move). No patience when making mistakes, if you are making mistakes they will tell you what you are doing, but they will not help you improve that or teach you how and they have fired people because of that instead of being diverse and understanding we all are different. Depending on the department you are applying for, you will be force to work overtime hours because you have to, not if you want to. Because of the high volume they are always getting. A lot of departments are under staff because everyone is quitting or they just fired people they don't like. Diversity and inclusion at 3M Costa Rica is not real, if you are not how they want you to be, you will be a bad employee and they will do everything they can to get you fired. So, if you feel they are trying to do this, I would recommend you to start looking for other jobs because they will make your work environment the worst you could have. Analyze your supervisor and confirm if you could trust her/him because depending on the person, they will use your problems against you. Requesting vacations or free time becuase you need to do something personal is a pain. You always have to explain yourself and let them know ""how important"" is what you need to do, so they can give you the free time or your vacations. There is NO intrinsic motivation. This is not important for them. YOU should look for your own motivation. Advice to Management:Train your mid level managers so they can truly be leaders instead of bosses micromanaging their employees.",0.6578070175438597,0.09394736842105267,positive
"Production Support Engineer in Minneapolis, MN",4,2022-03-17T00:00:00.000Z,61362808,"Productive and Respectful Work Environment, Weak Pay and Benefits  I think the biggest boon for my division is the hiring practices -- everyone on the team is communicative and competent, but also respects your time and are not invasive. I have never had a manager interrogate me about why I was late to a shift or what kind of appointment I'm going to. As long as you accomplish your work, nobody will demand more than that of your time. Other employees are eager to encourage other team members to take time off or leave when it's their time to leave. Managers have been very flexible as I have chosen to change my daily schedule. Functionally unlimited PTO. This is an unspoken situation with the contractor. Low workload. My skillset is respected in my workplace but my work takes less than half a day to accomplish. I was kept on after covid hit -- I was hired just before the pandemic and would've have been the LIFO layoff, however 3M was conservative and our division was lucrative so layoffs were unnecessary. I am very grateful for job stability during this time. 3M has decided to be a ""flexible"" working environment. Specifically, employees can now choose to be entirely remote, hybrid, or exclusively in office. ""Flat"" management structure. Project level teams determine leadership naturally. Most employees are very independent. Little hierarchy between employees and management. 3M is a well respected employer and looks great on a resume.  Contract work -- I am not technically employed by 3M and don't get 3M benefits. Almost half of my division functions this way. This is a sector wide problem, not exclusive to 3M at all. I haven't had a pay increase in 2.5 years. My pay is low to midrange for a starting wage in my position with my skillset, and has not increased. This position in my division functions as a junior software dev position, but I have been given no information about what I need to do to be promoted after half a dozen quarterly reviews, all of which described my work as immaculate. My daily work does little to advance my skillset towards this end. I have made independent efforts to take on extra work to prove that I'm ready to be promoted, but this has not been acknowledged as a meaningful move forward. These cons are very high impact -- I would rate the employer as a 3.5 given the choice, but decided to err to 3 stars because of the gravity of these cons. Advice to Management:Create clear goals to be promoted or gain raises. Institute a COLA raise for contract employees. Offer meaningful trainings and education opportunities which lead to promotion or pay increases.",0.37719369369369365,0.07206306306306307,positive

It almost sounded too good to be true. It could have been a dream job.  CW's are treated as sub humans. If 3M could have found a machine to do your job you wouldn't be there in the first place. You don't matter, and you will be reminded in subtle and not so subtle ways regularly. Don't fall for the lie that you are going to get hired soon. There is a good chance you will hear this repeatedly to keep you on the hook so you stay. The fact is you will work hard and waste years diligently, constantly proving yourself only to be reminded you are not a 3Mer. YOU ARE NOT ONE OF US CW. You can't participate in so many things as a result of being a CW, you get isolated. 3M Club? No, CW's can't be a part of that ""Enhancing 3M Culture since 1934"" club. That culture is exclusive, only for 3Mers. This is what an inclusive place for all looks like? What it looks like is alienation. Advice to Management:3M talks big about diversity and inclusion, how about including CW's then? STOP allowing managers and supervisors to deceive CW's into thinking they are going to be hired. STOP with these blatant, willful, deliberate lies about becoming a 3M FTE. STOP distinguishing your CW's from your FTE's. Putting CW at the end of their name and email address is demoralizing. This doesn't make them feel good about themselves or what they do for you. The fact 3M feels a need to do this to single them out is borderline discriminatory. Practice what you preach, show some gratitude to these people who work so hard for you everyday, hoping to be hired.

The culture has changed and become cut throat. Divisional Leadership dont appear to care about their employees and leadership is not being transparent. Employees have lost trust in leadership and are looking elsewhere. Its sad to see current leadership forgetting core values and practices that made 3M great and I hope they correct course soon before the damage is permanent. New programs are aimed at benefitting workers under 35 and long time 3M employees that didnt have those benefits get to pick up the slack.

"Patient Support Specialist in Saint Paul, MN",1,2022-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,57650411,"Toxic/Deceiving Bottom of the Totem Pole Role  Youre compensated well, great benefits, and given a company car.  The PSS role is a mandatory two year role with virtually no work life balance. You basically are constantly on call but not in a fun or fulfilling way. Weekend calls/emails will exclusively consist of paperwork and dealing with problems/impossible timelines. Its marketed as a sales role but it is almost exclusively a paper pushing sales support role. Its a role where youre constantly painted as the bad guy to the healthcare workers you interact with and its quite common your phone calls immediately ruins their day (they will not be shy with letting you know this). Because the revenue you bring in isnt nearly as large as the legitimate med sales reps, management doesnt always care or attempt to recognize when youre performing well or overachieving. Other teams may be different but my current manager does nothing to invest in my future or growth as a sales rep. Ultimately I feel as though everyone in this position wants to leave it as soon as possible but management wont want to promote you if youre stable given the role is so undesirable and unfulfilling. My advice to anyone considering this role is to be fully aware that its primarily not a selling role, you will have to work every weekend/holiday, unplugging on vacation is almost impossible, and you will be stuck in the role for a minimum of two years before youre eligible to be promoted. You are unapologetically the bottom of the totem pole. Also keep in mind the turnover rate for the role is astronomical at the 2 year mark (youre basically gambling that youll be promoted and then move companies if youre not). Advice to Management:Advertise that the PSS role is NOT primarily a selling role and make it abundantly clear to employees who are preforming well that they are on track to move up into a real selling role. Show more appreciation for the long hours/weekends/holidays the employees in this role have to put in.

Decisions are made with a complete lack of transparency and you can never trust that follow through will happen. Expectations that US employees must be available and work around the clock which causes burnout and resentment. Continual leaning of the workforce and refusal of leadership to prioritize means many employees are doing the job of multiple people while also wasting their time on initiatives that will never come to fruition. HR is a joke. Promotions are purely political and terrible managers are tolerated for years. Real diversity will never happen; as a former manager, I know they have no actionable plan to accomplish it. Advice to Management:Listen to your employees and resource your true priorities. Try to distinguish between the glad-handers and the people actually getting work done. Value experience, accomplishments and expertise over buzzwords. You do not know what Agile means. Try to figure it out. Get rid of all the crappy executives who have no idea what theyre doing. You are hemorrhaging talent because of poor leadership.

"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN",1,2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,56068288,"Miserable  Getting the brand name on your resume. Pay and benefits seem relatively competitive. Some really great people.  Slow moving, bureaucratic, and nearly entirely driven by internal political games. The majority of management within 3M is made up of ""lifers"" who have been here for upwards of 30 years, most riding out a pension, who are unwilling to let go of outdated and ineffective methods of operating. It is next to impossible to get up to speed quickly as a new employee at 3M due to the sheer size and the disorganized complexity that is the organizational structure. Unless you get lucky enough to know someone who knows someone, you'll never be able to get what you need to do your role successfuly day to day. Transparency is entirely absent, critical decisions are consistently made behind closed doors leaving out any opportunity for feedback from vested parties who will end up being affected. Lack of communication is rampant and results in constant project delays, scope misalignment, and a persistent lack of trust between employees and their chain of management. Effective prioritization and project managment is nowhere to be found. Prioritization does not seem to be taken seriously and is completely devoid of reason, priorities are changing so often and so inconsistely nothing can ever be fully accomplished. Every shift happens at break neck speed and is always something reactionary to achieve short term goals, and never proactively looking at what long term consequences they will have to the business. To say 3M is practing Agile in any meaning of the word is comical. Top talent is being hemorrhaged left and right and it's only getting worse as time goes on. This is creating a snowball effect that is causing remaining employees toughing it out to be overburdened without any type of acknowledgment or assistance in terms of compensation or additional resources. Burn out can be seen at every turn and I fear what that will mean long term for the health of the business. Advice to Management:Please take this honest feedback to heart and do what you can to drive change from within. As countless other reviews have stated, trust in your employees, listen your employees, and know that even though this may seem harsh many of us truly want to help 3M suceed. We are not given the proper outlets to express these types of concerns, you're not going to hear this type of feedback when it's being cycled through layers upon layers of middle managers. The unfortunate reality is, without anonymity, you will never get the feedback you really need to hear to succeed.",0.5099877958920512,0.028572579902367133,positive

Top employees and experienced employees are leaving or have left, leaving more work piled on top of fewer and fewer workers with less and less experience. It's a terrible feedback loop. Advice to Management:Stop creating new flavor-of-the-day initiatives. After prioritizing, resource accordingly. Stop promoting bad managers. It's okay to fire bad people and develop good people. 3Ms greatest blind spot is that it thinks it has ""world class manufacturing"" when there is little incentive for the smartest people to work in manufacturing instead of research and development.

In the chase for shareholder value, company forsake strategy, innovation, localisation, empowerment, transform company into top-down business-led culture for technology company.  Plenty. R&amp;D measured using Salesforce=No more smart goals setting. Just rely on your sales partner for your performance rating=performance rating not based on own performance, but dependent on others. Regionalised reporting structure means limited career opportunities. Subsidiaries with smaller sales volume may never get promoted. Advice to Management:Wake up. The current direction will make the company end up weaker than during McNerney's term. All the efforts to bring back the innovation essence by Buckley has been completedly eroded. Compare european companies with US companies and you will see how lacking a long term strategy slowly brings the company down. Look at the big auto firms, why german autos are selling like hot cakes, but US autos are not? German CEOs stay around for 10-20 year terms. US CEOs only stay a few years as Wall street wants to see numbers quickly. A strategy will surely but slowly bring numbers up, but no strategy will surely but slowly bring numbers down.

Operator,1,2021-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,44687193,"Not a family company  Triple pay for holidays. Vacation time when you start.  There is zero work/life balance. They do not care if you have a family, scheduled appointments or obligations outside of work. They expect you to cancel if you are forced in on OT and to always put the company first, even above your family. One of several examples: if your child is sick and you need to call in, you have to say that YOU are sick. You can't say that your child is sick or you won't be allowed the time off. The converting department is one of the most toxic in the building which is why they struggle to keep the dept. staffed. The gossip makes the environment hard to work in. In addition to associates, some of the group leads gossip openly and within ear shot about associates they don't care for despite the company posters everywhere about gossip and acting professional. Associates are incredibly hard on (almost to the point of bullying) - those hired off the street that didn't have to go through the temp agency (Volt) and management does nothing to address this ongoing issue. With that said, associates that have been there longer will be heard over you, even if they're dishonest. You ca do and act any way you wish if you've been there a long time and not be held accountable. You have no voice with anyone until you've been there a few years. Management doesn't like to address issues. There's more of an interest in making the problem go away than there is in fixing it. Only come to them with department ideas and never come to them with problems that need addressing. If you're ever accused of something there, just take your lickings and move on, even if you didn't do it. They like smooth sailings and will see you as a problem if you disrupt that for them. Advice to Management:Could be a good place to work if management were more professional and utilized a spine when it came to addressing issues as opposed to brushing the issues under the carpet as to not have to deal with them. If confrontation and dealing with issues are intimidating for you, you shouldn't be in management.",0.419047619047619,-0.02287784679089028,negative

I spent my entire first month on the phone with I.T. (per my manager's instructions) trying to set up the majority of their many programs (Delair, Hero, etc.) So much training time was wasted in the week long class alone, as almost everyone had issues. Most people in my class weren't even in my department. This greatly hindered productivity and furthermore, requiring overtime is absolutely ludicrous when your regular shift is spent waiting around for I.T. to return your call (which they frequently did at 4AM). I was never once warned that once the position turns permanent, you're expected to work OT without exception. Sometimes even receiving emails the Friday evening before people began their OT the following Monday. I left for a multitude of reasons after an entire month of red flags. Management seems nice but expects a LOT with little regard to work-life balance. Unless you want to spend your time struggling with software to the point of being in tears, don't waste your time. When I brought these issues to light, I was met with constant empty statements such as ""hang in there!"" As you can tell by this review, I found it completely fruitless to ""hang in there."" One day I'll look back and laugh at the incompetence but for now, I fear for the new bright-eyed temps and employees who are looking for honest work without being exploited. The generation of people who expect direct communication in lieu of wavering, false positivity. The generation of people who don't wish to logon to Microsoft Teams to see memes making light of mandatory OT, while accompanying this unprofessionalism with baleful emails claiming no exceptions will be made for anyone. This is a monopoly, and one you won't win unless you're CEO making at least six figures. What a joke.

The problem is that 3M decisions were already too slow, and are now even slower. Senior leaders are making even more decisions well BELOW their pay grades.

As you can tell, 3M middle management and senior technical corps (T5/JG 14 to L3) have been fully demotivated and disillusioned. Those that the company has not already laid off are heading for the exits. Dear 3M competitors, If you ever wanted to go about poaching top talent out of 3M, now is the time. You will find that many 3Mers that previously said they would never, ever leave the company are actively looking.

Sales Representative/Territory Manager,4,2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,43133179,"Great company but priorities are unclear  Tonnes of great, helpful people! Fantastic work-life balance is not just promoted but implemented well enough. Fantastic internal colleague recognition promotes collaboration, but maybe should be promoted even more. Diversity and inclusion is great at 3M - it helps you to continue being yourself, being unique but still be welcomed by the 3M community. I love seeing and hearing other colleagues' culture and even ways of how they tackle the same problem. 3M is also a massive pool of knowledge - there are plenty of amazing experienced and knowledgeable colleagues that are willing to share their talent to help you grow too! The 3M brand itself and the great-performing products helps us to do our job easier. It allows to focus more on customer problems rather than worrying if our product will perform to the customer's standards or not. Lots of opportunities and 3M actually promotes you to try different roles to help you grow your career.  Too many systems that are usually not connected to each other, creating more admin work. Too many job overlaps meaning there are usually 10 people that will want to do the same job, creating too much internal politics, slows the process down instead of accelerating things. Digital adaptation is extremely slow. Too much product training. I would prefer to focus your sales people on certifications as they can help the individuals in their career long-term, but inside or outside 3M. Once they have acquired these certification, accelerate their pay straight-away. You would then end up with staff that are compensated for acquiring more knowledge. Like Richard Branson once said, ""Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they don't want to."" Too much internal chatter. I feel internal meetings' audiences should be limited to only the people that would benefit from the meeting. Big 250+ audiences I feel are unnecessary, spending over 20% per week in most cases on meetings alone, especially during the pandemic lockdown! My suggestion is to cascade the message through your managers, then ONLY IF NECESSARY, set up meetings with your team but with a 'narrowed-down' tone. If it can't be done in an email, don't take your staff's time on an hour's worth of meetings. In my role in Sales, the Activity Metrics are just numbers and I feel the wrong metrics are measured (in most cases). Quantity is measured more than Quality therefore if not done carefully, it can have a negative impact on the staff as they will be driven in the wrong direction. I also feel the the 3M Culture of leadership behaviours are great, but because the managers do not measure it, it becomes nothing but buzz words, especially 'Foster Collaboration and Teamwork'. The current Advance 3M model should promote interconnectivity globally to help us become much more productive and would ensure that our customers are assisted in the quickest, most efficient way possible. Stop giving people jobs for the sake of creating a job but we should utilise the fantastic global resources we have available! Advice to Management:Manage the staff rather than saying 'oh this is what we have to do because that's the decision from the top-down'. Happy employees are more productive but if we keep doing things because that's what we are told to do, without justification, then it becomes just another corporate company. I would also suggest to give your staff the freedom to be creative, be innovative rather than telling them protocols (as long as they are not breaking the rules obviously). Again, ""Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they don't want to.""",0.5300245919964229,0.18641571652135033,positive

Advanced Product Development Specialist,1,2021-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,42649831,"Innovative Playground but with Toxic Features  3M is an amazingly innovative company. As a scientist, working at 3M is like being a kid living in a toy store. It's a wonderful feeling being a part of world-class innovation. I absolutely love the work I do, and it's a real thrill to develop exciting products alongside other passionate scientists and engineers.  Unfortunately, 3M seems to have some major faults, especially in today's sociopolitical climate. It's hard to write this, but it's important to share. From my point of view as a scientist and product developer, 3M seems to care more about its shareholders and its managers than it does about the people inventing and manufacturing the products that make our company relevant. This is a sad situation and I think 3M can do better. The first step is acknowledging some of its many serious missteps: 3M cut jobs and salaries during the pandemic, but somehow had plenty of cash to pay out as dividends to rich investors on Wall Street. This makes very little sense from an organizational health perspective. And it makes even less sense from a social justice perspective where income inequality is such a strong forced for much of the negativity we see in the US right now. Furthermore, 3M promotes and rewards managers who lay off productive and valuable workers with no regard for the pandemic-rattled job market. Leadership would do better by 3M to adopt a Stakeholder Mindset. 3M claims to be an inclusive company committed to sustainability and equality, but continues to reward career sharks who stifle truly sustainable innovation and the diverse people who drive that innovation. 3M cancels programs and stifles innovations that offer true sustainability (even ones with objectively excellent profitability) in favor of gratuitously high and unsustainable profit margins. 3M further rewards the same lock-step managers who feed this toxic culture, and stifles the careers of those who try to make a positive impact to our global society. As a scientist and global citizen, it is incredibly hard to see this happening at such an ostensibly progressive company like 3M. While 3M is truly excellent at charitable donations around the world, there are serious internal problems with diversity and inclusion. I applaud 3M's philanthropy, and hope to see improvements in culture internally. For example, while we do have quite a few underrepresented groups in leadership roles, many of these people have the same career shark mentality that prevents the people they're representing in their demographic from thriving and attaining similar success. Now, this message board ensures that ""each employer has the right to respond to a review left by a member for free, and that the employer be given the last word on a review."" I enthusiastically invite a response to this thoughtful review - with the counterargument that our planet, 3M's employees and customers, and humanity's global society always have the last word. 3M needs to do better. The good news is that we can do better. We have many excellent people. We just need to have the right people in leadership roles. Suggestions are provided below. Advice to Management:1. We need a flatter organization where toxic leadership has nowhere to hide. 2a. We have too much turnover in middle management, to the point that the people running important businesses and laboratories simply don't understand the businesses or labs they are running. Self-promoting behavior and short-sighted decisions leading to poor growth and lack of morale are the long-lasting consequences of this. 2b. If we continue allowing this kind of turnover in leadership, then we need our leaders to have a transparent and traceable track record of successes and failures to discourage myopic and unsustainable business strategies. 3. Our people need a clear and measurable path to success - not an opaque machination wherein director-level leaders determine the success or failure of their employees' careers on personal whim. 4. We need an HR organization that works to make 3M's systems benefit everyone's career, not just the managers. 5. Finally, we need to take innovation seriously. Class 4+ innovation requires consistent financial commitment, organizational alignment, championing, and most importantly rewards and career advancement for the hard-working people who advance those innovations. Class 4+ innovation does not always lead to commercialized products. But the IP and internal knowledge generated in the process is still valuable - and it needs to be rewarded if 3M wants its strong community of scientists and engineers to take intelligent risks at high-growth-potential Class 4+ programs. 6. Stop buying back shares of stock. This is completely antithetical to organic growth. Instead, invest money in employees' careers, in R&amp;D, in go-to-market strategies, and in strategic acquisitions. 7. Tie raises and Annual Incentive Pay (called bonuses in other companies) to dividend dispersals. If 3M can afford to pay cash to investors, then 3M can properly reward the hard-working people who created that value in the first place.",0.47827423512816764,0.1850730215477407,positive

(But, lots of managers who aren't want to put down others and get defensive).  - Still a pretty heavy white Boys club, especially in upper management. There are some female/non-white/non-binary faces, but not enough throughout the org, ESPECIALLY in engineering - The Job function structure is opaque, I've interviewed people who were to be in a grade above me with less experience in my skill set - A lot of the brilliant engineers I've worked with are actually Contractors/employees of Stelligent, so they don't stick around - 3M HIS seems to have trouble hiring/finding talent for some reason--HR I think doesn't know how to recruit Software Engineering folks, so a lot of Managers and team leads are doing double duty finding people. Hiring process is SUppppppper slow/drawn out/unorganized so we lose candidates before we can even interview them - Definite disconnect between the actual engineers and management who controls our destiny (I get the sense that no one read my resume/I've gotten silo-ed/forgotten) - Corporate policies are still not quite there with functioning like a software company - There's no on-call : the reason this is a negative is because they haven't designed it yet. The teams are really advanced/accelerated in some aspects and in the dark ages in others.

I worked for 4-5 bosses in 5 years (in a number of roles) and really enjoyed working for all of them. They usually make good, quality products (although this is starting to wane in recent years).  They move too slow. There are so many 25+ year employees, so they don't want to move up young talent quickly. Therefore, there is a large amount of complacency in the organization. They do not have a modern selling or marketing strategy, very ""old-school"". Advice to Management:Understand younger employees. Give them incentives to stay at 3M (financial and opportunities). Quit announcing massive layoffs just to slot those same 30+ year employees into every open position. In the US, 3M has decided incentivizing sales reps is not necessary (""due to ERP system change"") and this has severely hurt sales rep morale and productivity.

Everyone seems to uphold the companies values and in my two years working there I have not met anyone I wouldn't want to work with again. It is a large company so there is some ""Bureaucracy"" but I have never found it to hinder my job. The thing I like most about 3M is their flexibility in working and their willingness to do what is best for the employees and company rather than just the shareholders like many other companies in todays world. They are very ""conservative"" in their approach so don't expect crazy high salaries and crazy new world perks(like unlimited PTO, drinking at work, constant parties) but I have found everything about my job and its benefits to be fair or better than average. The most surprising thing to me about 3M is how many employees have been there 20, 25, 30+ years and still love their job, I think that is a testament to how well 3M treats their people.  I really cant think of very many cons.

It's a good way to get your foot in the door and learn some of the technology.  They cap working hours for tech aide at 900 hours per year and no more than 32 hours per week. You have to work out your work hours with your manager. Generally, when school is not in session (i.e. summer), you get to work 4 days a week. During school year, depending on your schedule, you can work up to 32 hours a week (but remember you cannot go over 900 hours per year total). There is not overtime for this position. Getting a full-time position is extremely difficult. Basically, the application pool (both internally and externally) is very competitive. Start networking with different people within your department and other department so you can get an idea of what full-time position/area you want to work on after graduation. Most of the job you ended up applying for or interviewed for will be cancelled due to business circumstances or on hold because the hiring managers already have someone in mind even before posting the jobs.",0.47149122807017535,0.17850877192982456,positive

"Inside Sales Representative in Saint Paul, MN",2,2020-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,37928080,"No ISR makes Plan-Commissions are BS  Decent culture in the company at large. Almost cult like the positivity people exhibit about being there. The company does a good job of making you proud of being a 3mer.  Before I start, lets start with a simple presumption, Sales people want to make money. The harder they work, and more success they have, the more money they should make. This is NOT the premise the entire Inside Sales Dept. follows. If you are looking for the premise above, look elsewhere. If you are fine putting in a decent amount of hard work, keep your head down, have no drive to make 6 figures, and instead are cool with a annual 2% raise in your base salary to have a shot in 3 years of a 10-15% raise into a higher level ISR. Sign up for this sales job...which really is a glorified order taker or account manager. It is a high base salary 65-75k account manager role. This is not a professional ISR role in whatever dept you end up in. The commission plans are inept. No one makes plan the commission plan changed 6 times in 12 months. Most of the time we were on guarantee as management had no clue what they were doing. If you want to receive commission, and excel into higher yearly gross...That is NOT the path 3M takes. The Inside Sales department is valued by the company at large and is receiving lots of investment, BUT it doesnt translate into common sense. No one exceeds plan, no one. That means the plan is BS. It is simply a salaried position and is an embarrassment for a Fortune 100 to state otherwise. But thats what you get when you have a national inside sales director with no sales experience. See, 3M promotes only from within so they have the same silly po-dunk, middle of the road, conservative ideas that the C-level scientist leaders above then think are sensible. Not one ISR makes above 100k with commissions. Several make 90k as a base salary, but thats it...theres no commission happening, maybe 5k annually...is that a sales role? You tell me. Lastly- if youre a woman or a minority-beware of the grade level they hire you in at...no matter how qualified you are for other roles in the company they have a strict HR rule that limits upward promotion. Dumbest thing I saw was a co-worker, who had more qualifications than most of the competition, was not allowed to sit for interviews with hiring managers that were interested in her, because as a minority she was initially hired in at such an entry level ranking, (way below what she was worth on the open market to save money) and therefore, even though she exceeded the qualifications on the job listing and the managers wanted to interview her, she was denied the change to interview because it beyond 2 steps from her ranking. Total BS for a company that prides itself on diversity. She would have had to leave the company and apply for the job (unlikely to get a call because they prioritize promoting from within), or wait 10 yrs before she is able to interview for the dream position that she is qualified for now...talk about a bunch of middle aged HR/c level white guys golfing on the company course thinking up policies. But dont worry well send gobs of promotional emails and team newsletters swearing that we prioritize and appreciate our female and minority colleagues...HAHAHA! Advice to Management:Look at your high performers...does anyone make commission? Look at your low performers...do they make the same as your high performers while doing wayyy less work? That means your comp structure is broke. Your annual rating will be different, is not a good incentive.

"Operator in Springfield, MO",1,2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,35414401,"Forces political beliefs on workers  A job that pays money  3M is your typical corporation, and for those who have seen the documentary, The Corporation, you'll know what I mean. In addition to that, the Springfield plant is no different than any other workplace, especially large factories - favoritism, discrimination, unfairness, backbiting, the good-ole-boy network, good workers are punished, slackers are rewarded, silly rules, rules that are just made up when convenient, wasted time and money, the blame game, and the common mismanagement pretty much sums it up. Compensation needs to be improved, about $5-$10hr more plus profit sharing, since the workers are dealing with deadly chemicals and therefore endangering themselves, their co-workers, and the community. Mandatory overtime can be a problem and you will be expected to work 19 12-hour days straight to meet business needs. But they will give you 2 days off only to repeat the 19 days if necessary, because they care about you and your family, so they say. With that said, after nearly 4 years of service I was terminated for not conforming to the political beliefs of 3M that were being forced upon the workers. For the last 5 months of my employment I put up with the new policies, the signs, the emails, and verbal communications regarding so-called COVID-19 and didn't dare question any of it, since questioning the Narrative is strictly forbidden. Despite the absurdities, the lies, the insults, the guilt-tripping, and all of us being treated like children, I remained quiet and said nothing. Even when some mystery dude came around spraying everything and everybody in the break room while we were trying to eat, I just fled the scene and allowed him to continue. As the mask ritual became the latest brainwashing campaign, 3M Springfield brought this charade into the plant and distributed masks for voluntary use, twice, which I simply ignored as did everyone else. At this point I became concerned because I knew the Plan was calling for mandatory participation, so my dignity line was drawn. Being forced to wear some dehumanizing mask that marks my acceptance of an immoral agenda and implies I am contaminated and that my co-workers are contaminated crosses that line, and I refuse to be disrespected and degraded by selfish, unloving people who simultaneously puff themselves up to be virtuous, be it 3M or anywhere else. After the mandatory mask announcement I requested a personal leave of absence with 3M Springfield HR due to religious objections to wearing a mask for this purpose. After supposedly discussing with the team for over a week, the HR manager and whoever is on this team, as expected, did not approve the leave, did not offer an accommodation, and would not let me in the plant without a mask even though I was willing and able to work, so the official termination is blamed on absenteeism. Most people are aware that this mask agenda has nothing to do with health and safety, no matter how much the order-followers lie and chant their mantra, but rather compliance, conditioning, symbolism, ritual, and superstition. If anyone desires to work with 3M, or any other large corporation, be prepared to be treated like a dumb animal because the mask is only the beginning, so it may be best to just avoid the trap and not even give these seared-conscience people the satisfaction of forcing their inhumane beliefs upon you.

Forced Overtime is a major problem here, especially during the summer. They do not know how to staff correctly to obtain a good work/life balance. Warehouse workers are forced to endure long hours, short breaks and lunch periods, favoritism, awful treatment from unqualified leads, terrible supervisors, unbelievably complacent HR, an awful and inaccurate productivity system. They don't listen to any ideas or improvements, and constantly blame warehouse workers for their ineptitude in the office and poor warehouse management systems. All decisions are made by those who have never worked in the warehouse, and frankly, do not care about us at all. When the pandemic hit, we were declared essential workers and forced into ridiculous safety protocols, but no haz pay. They don't even care if we die. There is no recognition at all. Those who try to work hard are not rewarded. Most of the people who don't work get better positions and higher pay. It is all about kissing butt. It is a dead end job really. Communication is pretty much non-existent. Upper management all the way down to lead operators all need basic communication classes, psycho therapy, and taught how to treat people in a decent manner. The warehouse management systems they use are slow and buggy. They also use outdated equipment that is used 24 hours a day/7 days a week. All in all... Stay away from here... Advice to Management:Warehouse workers are human beings and deserve to be treated like it.. If we are in a Pandemic, we are in danger.

There's not a lot of time or money spent in frivolities here, so if you want silly perks, huge admerch budgets and a lot of fun &amp; games, this is definitely NOT the place for you. On the other hand, if you're not intimidated by science, you want to learn a lot, get your hands dirty and handle very complex products often harshly challenged by cheaper, crappier versions of them, this is the place for you. People in general are very nice and you can make friends here however. If you're smart and work hard, you will find a lot of opportunities to grow, but they seldom come to knock at your door. You have to network and sell yourself, which is very hard for some of us and very easy for those who often deserve less. Overall, a great company, more diverse than most because it's Global, but with work to do in the diversity department still.  2 things: - I wish 3M tried harder to detect and recognize work truly well done and good employees. In general (there are exceptions), if you're not as talented a self-promoter as you are an employee, don't play the squeaky wheel game wisely or have an Ivy League education, you might be eternally overlooked for promotions or sexier assignments (my boat is more rocked by increasing responsibilities than increasing pay, but that's me), no matter what your successes and accomplishments are. This can be especially true with women and minority employees. In the company there are still big pockets with a total old boys' club mentality - I wish creativity and thinking outside the box was rewarded and encouraged beyond the R&amp;D functions. Considering our budgets, it is very important to be creative in all functions, especially Marketing. We need more doers and more people willing to think and do things differently. Advice to Management:- Find and reward good performance properly. - BEWARE the sociopath of the species: One would be too many, but in reality there are many people in leadership positions who are downright sociopaths. They thrive by ""managing up"" but they are often incompetent at anything else but manipulation, and wreak havoc down below to the point that great employees get their spirit broken and leave the company or end up with PTSD. Believe me, whatever the cost of detecting them and getting rid of them is, it is absolutely worth it, based on the destruction and chaos they cause in entire organizations.",0.5464170274170275,0.16250937950937955,positive

In my area of engineering, around 90% of employees are white men. There is a large initiative to hire more diverse candidates, but the company fails to realize that hiring diverse candidates into a non diverse work culture leads to high turnover. The company needs to roll out mandatory diversity and inclusion discussions and training for all engineering employees if they want to retain any diverse candidates they hire. I have brought this up to HR and I was encouraged to lead this effort on my own, but such a response is putting the burden of change on employees who don't have the bandwidth to lead an additional effort, rather than making a proactive choice and hiring or appointing a team to focus on this issue. With that being said, 3M does do a good job at promoting job flexibility.

Supply Chain Analyst,5,2019-12-04T00:00:00.000Z,30701769,"Great Experience and Company  I absolutely loved working for 3M. There is this pride that I would say most employees have working for them because it is such a good company and you get to work on some really cool products that are used every day all over the world. In my personal experience, I always knew my management team had my back and they were excellent coaches and mentors, which can be hard to come by. I was able to work autonomously and create projects I wanted to work on and It was easy to get the resources you needed whether it was in the plant, through sister plants, or though their intracompany website (which is the only company Ive worked for that I would say had a useful one). In my plant, the systems rarely made intuitive sense, but they worked and we did quite well as far as OTIF and Customer Service levels were concerned, so you could only make things better and more efficient, which is a great position to be in. Lastly, my coworkers were just down to earth. While you always will have the negative folks in any workplace, most people I worked with knew what their goals were and just wanted to achieve them with as little mellow drama as possible and get paid (which 3M also does well).  3M is a baby boomer dressed in millennial's clothing. On the outside they seem really hip and trendy, but you soon learn the inner workings of the company are still that of a behemoth Fortune 500 company; change is hard to push and there is a lot of red tape to get some things approved. My main complaint would be the lack of vacation days provided from the start. I've worked for a lot of different multinational corporations; the ones that are competitive for great employees give at least 3 weeks vacation to start with. But, I actually had to give up a week of my vacation time when I joined 3M as they would not negotiate this outdated norm that new employees should only have 2 weeks to start with. This was actually one of my main reasons for leaving the company, as I live across the country from where my family is and I did not get to see them as much as I had before because travel times were just too long to get back home within a 2-3 day weekend. I worked for 3M for over 2 years, and I would have had to wait another 2 just to get that 3rd week. I did get a month of sick days, but I was not allowed to use them for medical appointments, which in 2019 I happened to have a lot of. So, I had to use my vacation time for these. The one time I got to go home in 2019 was for my grandmother's funeral, and I had to beg for 2 days of bereavement leave instead of the allowed 1 to compensate for the travel. Im not looking for sympathy, I just find it perplexing that a company that says it is as socially responsible as they say they are has not kept up with the times on this policy.

"Analyst in Albany, NY",3,2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,30536111,"Good compensation package, low/non-competitive salary, no opportunity for growth  Flexible work arrangements--many people take WFH days or essentially work remotely. Match is 5% on 401k and company gives an additional 3% so it's 8% on 401k. Health is good, get $600 (for individual; family is higher) toward HSA if you take high deductible plan. The work is exceedingly simple and there is minor stress given the lack of challenge. If you work with your ""manager"" (many are really not managers at all...), you can ensure a good work balance and never work more than 40 hours per week. I know people who get their work done in under 40 every single week. If you want to settle for low salary but great benefits and essentially a mindless job that is impossible to get fired from, then sign up. Maternity and paternity leave are good and so many people have a few kids then leave once they don't need/can't use that benefit anymore.  The pay is non-competitive and everyone is guaranteed a 3 (on a 1 to 5 Likert scale) on their performance reviews (which are a complete joke and if they mean nothing, then management should really just get rid of them). This means you can plan on 2% increases forever...until it's ""your turn"" to get a 4 and then you might get 4%. Promotions are rare and people end up leaving after a few years because if you stay here you lose money and become non-competitive in the work force. The people that stay are the lifers who have never had a job outside of Treo/3M (and frankly don't have the skills to be competitive on the market). Do not take a job with 3M thinking you can quickly move up because it's such a big company with tons of opportunity--I see PhDs who are not moving up and are clearly qualified.

Our campus will be totally sustainable by 2020. Ethics in business are very good. If you get to management level you may have access to Long Term Incentives which do not vest immediately.

A clear path for advancement, monetary rewards since we no longer offer them Long Term Incentives, a Pension, a better 401K match, etc. Loyalty goes both ways.

One of the best cultures I've worked at in my career. Outside of inside sales I hear its great. Leadership from Mike Roman is solid. Long term career path if you work hard and build a network.  This is specific to inside sales and the current management in place. Management has never been in sales before. yet are in charge of sales. Lack of understanding about sales process and how a sales cycle even works. It has changed from sales performance to metric based ""calls"" and ""correct contacts"" rather than the customer focused top line. Many employees are calling it their call center job because that's where the current manager came from and runs it like that. Micromanagement and low morale haunts pieces of the personal safety division. If you apply go for some area outside of inside sales and you'll be much happier. If you apply for a job outside of the area they will block you from moving on stating its ""a business necessity"" looking at not a personal career move but you are costing them money because they have to hire someone new.

"Manager in Saint Paul, MN",1,2019-04-17T00:00:00.000Z,25731006,"Pay Well, Old Culture, Poor Leadership  Overall, they do pay well with good benefits. The overall base pay is strong, they match 401(k) at varying percentages based on level, offer an employee stock purchase program with a 15% discount and have the standard yearly pay increases  The company is clearly focused on and centered around B2B. They do not understand consumer driven businesses and do not adopt their business models and practices accordingly. If you come from a consumer based company, you will be very disappointed. Marketing budgets are consistently the first area to be cut and the company spends at approximately 1/3 of what other traditional CPG companies spend on marketing. They very much adopt the mindset of 'if you build a better mousetrap'. The company freely moves people in to roles where they have no experience or expertise. While I can appreciate the willingness to allow people to move freely within the company, they assign people to roles based on tenure, not experience or expertise. People with supply chain backgrounds run marketing, customer service backgrounds run sales departments and operations experts work in finance. Without a doubt, the core of this company is built around technical (R&amp;D) and operations. They do not understand nor care about marketing, strategy or sales. While the company claims to be focused on 'growth', all internal indications and behaviors clearly demonstrate they are focused on their historical nature of being a 'dividend' company. The company as a whole is terrible at prioritizing: every project, tactic and strategy is a priority. If you ask what is priority, the most common response will be 'all of them'. This lack of decisions making is consistent up and down leadership levels throughout the company. Very little, if any, decision making and prioritization is driven down in to the organization and employees are not empowered nor entrusted to make key decisions. Because of the historical pension program, the motivation is low among more tenured employees. Many are due to retire in the near future, with those that are near retirement uninterested in new ideas, business strategies or breakthrough innovation. The overall goal is to get to retirement without any significant change. Those with longer tenures do not value outside experience. Their is an unspoken understanding that those with outside experience are known for having 'A3' and 'B3' experience (i.e A.D. and B.C.).

"Project Manager in Maplewood, MN",5,2019-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,25221199,"19 years strong and going....  There's a reason I've been here 19 years. I can assure you that this company cares about it's employees. And whether or not it's apparent, cares tremendously about the environment, community and products it offers. The pay is competitive, the flexibility is a tremendous perk and it's fun and exciting. (And ever-changing right now!) The different types of jobs you can have are equally as amazing. Administrative assistant, production line assembly, project manager, software tester, project manager, Scrum master, security guard, quality assurance (testing of the products or programs), sales rep....the list goes on and on. If you find you don't like what you do - stick it out for 2 years and transfer to something else. All of my supervisors- with the exception of 1 - have ALWAYS worked with me to get me to my next step at the company. This is the place to have inspiration and aspirations - and be safe in knowing your work is appreciated. They encourage you to volunteer. They encourage you to get up out of your cube to take a walk. They encourage you to seek a mentor to get you through your professional career. Everyone I have encountered is more than happy to sit down with you and discuss your professional life and give you advice.  I'm a big believer that not all people can work at all companies. To work at 3M, you have to be flexible. Like - really flexible. And you have to work in ambiguous circumstances at times. If you're the type of person who always needs clear direction, probably not the best place for you. You have to NOT require constant supervision to get your job done. If you're in a leadership position, you have to have confidence in what you're doing and the ability to speak up and step out in a crowd when you have an opinion, yet know when to sit back and listen (and take some advice too!) You *will* have difficulties throughout your professional life - no matter what job you are in. From a manager who doesn't manage you the right way, to not being recognized on a project that you worked hard at, to arrogant people, etc. It's YOUR choice how you handle these things. Step up! Speak out! It's welcome at 3M - and with a bit of work (managing up!) - you can train your boss for what you need as well :) It's a big company - if you like small companies, this is not the place to work. You will more than likely have to walk over 100 feet to get to your desk. There are some that are still working in the ""old"" way - The ""good ol boys club"" - where you get promoted because you know them personally, etc. My advice - speak up when you feel shunned, do your part, and find another job in 2 years if it's not working out where you are. These are not deal breakers, but I can totally understand and appreciate difficulties through period of time. Advice to Management:Keep listening to us worker bees!

Salary, medical, and the 401k match are very competitive. 3M also offers a lot of development opportunities such as trainings, travel opportunities, and forums. Management is very flexible (usually) when it comes to working from home or alternative work schedules. You can really make your career your own and have many avenues and career paths to explore.

It seems like this is an inflexible, non-negotiable policy. 3M is still struggling with a stuffy, conservative culture as well. This culture is perpetuated by top level management.

They're extremely supportive within the areas they control. If you have a degree, you should be well off as long as you show you can do the job. If you don't have the degree, see below.  The only downside is the incredible difficulty in trying to get hired on without a degree. In this one respect, 3M does not appear to be inclusive nor want to be diverse. Whether the contractor has worked for 3M for years or the contractor has helped save the company hundreds of thousands/millions, 3M HR standards block the contractor from being hired on. Even when managers go to HR and ask for exceptions, they're turned down most of the time. This interaction with HR highlights the discrepancy of the 3M messages of inclusiveness and wanting diversity and actual application of HR standards (which should include education level as ALL people can contribute equally. Not all jobs need a degree. Most of what you need to know about many of the jobs at 3M is actually learned on the job). Advice to Management:Be more inclusive and diverse in who you look at for your employee pool. Listen to your department managers and their requests. They know the people they're looking to hire. If they ask you (HR) for an exception to hire, it is because the person is worth hiring.

Warehouse Associate,4,2018-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,22478939,"Incredible Benefits, but....  I've been with 3M for 21 years, at times it's hard to believe it's been that long. The Benefits, especially Medical, have been awesome.  I worked in a warehouse, in the beginning we were encouraged to want to advance. But as management changed, they made lead positions fixed and unless they left that position, there was never a chance to do more. They also didn't want ideas from the workers that did the same job everyday, they preferred to hire new engineers to do that. It was emphasized that a warehouse worker's thoughts were useless. The biggest Con, beware of being put on LTD. The facility i worked at, I could have worked in the office instead of permanent disability, but management for that facility preferred a separation of Office &amp; Warehouse. While it's great still getting medical benefits, the 60% pay of when you were put on LTD is rough. And there is no adjustment or pay increase if you are out for years. You will be quickly forgotten. As the Doctors have told me, it's the way of big business; they'd rather stick you in the system and forget than help you be beneficial to them. I truly love the company, the products are the absolute Best, but being forgotten on LTD is a road that leads to depression and self doubt. Advice to Management:People are your Biggest asset, just because they don't have a degree, doesn't mean they are all dumb. Was the Post-It Note purposely invented? Nope. I'm not saying all people can do something like that, but you'd be surprised how many have ideas that are told no thank you. And LTD, stop being like Big Business, care enough about your employees to Not Forget about these. These people are at home doing less than they want due to medical issues, but they can still exist on a computer, maybe they could still be a resource to help this company that they love.

Anonymous Employee,2,2018-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,22101719,"Great Company, But IT needs to change  3M management is trying hard to reinvent and innovate. Management and HR are trying hard to retain IT talent and going through business transformation with new SAP implementation. People at 3M are nice and professional. It provides work and life balance. 3M is making a great effort in moving forward with new IT culture.  Most people work at 3M IT full time do not have latest solid software development skills. That caused a lot of money being wasted. 3M relies on contracting firms ( most Indian firms) to deliver IT results. When things are not done on time, management has no clue as to why, because a lot of low level IT managers do not have any insights to evaluate, estimate and execute the project properly. Most IT managers do not have latest IT tech skills, instead, they have so called 'leadership skills"". If you are not a professional painter or have been a professional painter, it is harder for you to evaluate a professional painting job. How do you know that you get your money worth for such a job? Hardcore technical skills are not valued as much as soft 'Leadership"" skill. That resulted in a culture of promoting incompetent IT folks, these people then hire folks just like them, with no real hardcore software skills. It is a bad feedback loop. It wastes 3M's money. 3M has has an archaic HR structure, your manager is your key to success or failure at 3M. That does not fit in today's fast paced, democratic, meritocratic work culture. If your evaluation is deemed not satisfactory, your career at 3M is pretty much dead. That's why if you walk around 3M campus, you do not feel the vibrancy. 3M culture seems to promote niceness, niceness is great, but it does not help company's bottom line. Advice to Management:Promote IT employees with real hardcore skills to management positions, Create a culture which allows IT employee to move without current manager's approval. Because if you do not allow them to move within the company, they will move outside. That's a loss for 3M. Layoff all the talkers and keep the doers.

Many employees have a positive view of 3M if they work at the company headquarters. If you work at a manufacturing location you probably have a very different view. Many of the perks available at the headquarters are non existent at a plant location. Cost cutting measures generally impact the plant locations to a greater extent than corporate. 3M is quick to impose headcount and overtime restrictions at plants that cause significant pain for our customers when business is down across the company, even though it is still busy at the plant.

As so many people work at 3M for their entire career, coming in mid-career from the outside is difficult - your previous experience is discounted. The salary is average.

The work environment is great. The leadership is inspirational and ethical. Management does a good job of being available and open to new ideas. I've been here about 10 years and I stay because I feel appreciated. And honestly, there are so many job opportunities within 3M I can try new things or completely new careers while still keeping my professional network and leveraging resources across platforms. The organization is highly matrixed and there is a lot of collaborative, cross-functional work. The teams are good and everyone pulls their weight Also, benefits are great. Pay is competitive. Being outside the city, the St. Paul campus is easy to reach, traffic is good and the parking is reasonable at the HCBG site.  Some things are slow and deliberate. Getting people hired and getting projects funded can take longer than I would like, but they always get there in the end. 3M always runs lean. As a mid-level leader or manager, you should expect to also work as an individual contributor in some capacity. There is just never quite enough bandwidth on your teams.

Also I think the vacation is just what it needs to be. It starts a little low but grows over the time you are there. The unlimited vacation that gets tossed around in the tech world now is a big trap. It just allows them to pile more work on you, even though it feels nice to think you have unlimited vacation, you end up getting less than if you had a fixed amount.  AIP program is a joke.

Anonymous Employee,3,2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,20879212,"3M Canada is a shadow of its former self.  In general, the people are great and the work is interesting and rewarding at 3M Canada. The salary and benefits are better than many other companies. Working from home or, if you can't work from home, taking 'personal time' is an option which is great for times when unexpected things pop up like a sick child or you need to be home to meet a plumber, etc. Work-Life balance is OK most of the time. Lots of volunteer opportunities. Amenities at HQ in London, ON: lounge areas, subsidised flat-rate catered lunches; fitness centre with showers; on-site fitness classes; ping pong table; on-site nurse.  Overall, 3M is an ethical and somewhat transparent company but the management sometimes says one thing and does another, all the while pretending to take employees' opinions into consideration. In recent years, there have been more instances where a ""leader"" acts within their legal rights but the actions are not fair or ethical. It's unbecoming of the reputation that 3M has earned in the business world and with their employees previously. They are relying more and more on contract workers to fill gaps and save money without increasing head count or having to provide benefits. For several years of my tenure, contract workers had a reasonably good chance to get hired. In fact, I started as a contract worker and was hired in just over a year. Now, the time you can be on contract is limited and *very few* get hired on as permanent employees. Really good people that you rely on daily can be gone and replaced with a 'newby' at any time and you have to spend precious time training someone else to do what the previous person was very capable of doing. Employee morale is usually high but the recent changes in the C-suite and the decisions that they've been making over the last 2 years have betrayed the trust and dampened the spirit of a lot of people. Many great people have either left or been let go without true cause. Advice to Management:3M Canada used to be a place where opportunities were abundant and most employees really enjoyed going to work every day, myself included. The work wasn't easy but that's part of what made it a great place to work. The current atmosphere is stressful and riddled with uncertainty. Please start promoting ""leaders"" again, not ""bosses."" Bosses ""do things the right way"" -- their way or the highway -- and they can keep a business afloat in the short term. However, leaders ""do the right thing,"" by empowering, developing and trusting good people which ensures long-term business success...in other words, practice what you preach. Personality conflicts should not be considered ""cause"" to fire an employee with an (otherwise) good to excellent performance history. Find them a better 'fit' elsewhere in the company. Please don't pretend to ask for the employees' opinions when a decision has already been made at the corporate level. Just do it. That will cause much less resentment. Train all of your employees (especially young managers) on combating ageism which is becoming much more prevalent with the influx of younger workers. Older workers have a lot to offer and they deserve to feel appreciated and empowered like any other employee. No one should ask them out of the blue, ""So when are you retiring?"" in their first meeting with a new group or supervisor! Ultimately, I'm happy to not be employed at 3M Canada any longer. However, I am also very disappointed and sad that the 3M I loved working for no longer exists. It is simply a shadow of its former self.",0.4768889668889667,0.23265093015093016,positive

This place has horrible management, and truly couldnt care less about their employees. If youre lucky you might get a 1-2% raise no matter what your numbers for the year. The management is more knowledgeable on the procedures and policy than they are of the actual job. Writing people up and wasting their employees time for things that could be talked about and moved on from. They sure know how to micromanage people that have been doing the job for years, while talking to them like theyre idiots. Value? They dont value their employees at all. It doesnt matter if you consistently meet goals youre lucky to get an attaboy. The management follows rules and enforced rules as its convenient to them. Its a negative work environment, the pay isnt all that great and theres really no room for improvement. If youre not a favorite you dont get to work overtime. Advice to Management:An employee that feels appreciated will always go above and beyond. You could start there. Give your employees their birthday off.

"Crew Leader in Tonawanda, NY",4,2018-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,18612100,"32 YEAR  I worked 32 years in one plant, so my employment was solid. I made over 90k a year in the last three years I worked for them, but you had to be willing to work overtime to make it. I was a union employee. My base pay was 60k my co-worker from the first shift made over 125k in the last three years so you could imagine how much o.t. he worked. we had mandatory o.t. in some parts of the plant, but most of it was volunteer.  In my 32 years about 7 of it was hell for me and most of us do to very unforgiving management. But after the plant did a plant wide survey, union and non union, 240 surveys were handed in and ""ALL"" surveys were VERY negative, 3M st Paul was shocked by the survey and the work got back to us that it was the worst survey they ever received. But! I give them credit 3M(st paul) within one year all five plant leadership team were gone, two fired three other moved to other plants. I also give credit to the worker's both union and nonunion for standing up to them, that is what got me in trouble,I was always a few years ahead in my opinion of management and they did not like it. So i paid for that when we had the bad managers. When I left 5 months ago the management was ok, no bad eggs. There are not many cons because when you get hired you know what your in for has far as over time and other things that bother some employee's. BUT THE ONE CON I CAN'T LEAVE OUT, IS THERE IS NO PENSION, THEY STOPPED IT TEN YEARS AGO. THEY DO HAVE 401K AND A LITTLE EXTRA MATCH ON SAVINGS FOR new hires. So if you could find a job with a pension and a 401k and same pay,go for it. 3M doesn't make any promises when it comes to money. Advice to Management:Treat your employees with respect, it is the only way you will be respected, Come down from the ivory tower and talk to your employee's, we like to know what is going on.

You can choose your hours between 10-3pm - which is helpful for mums. Plus if you work ridiculous hours like me, this equates to an extra 12 days per year (however- I work around 45-50 hours a week on average)- so you could argue whether this is a real benefit or willing exploitation ?! You don't get overtime. You are given autonomy- you are left to get on with things and micromanagement is something that no one has time for!  Expectation that you will work at 120% all the time (what I mean by this is working at your fullest between 9-5 is never good enough) There are times you'll be expected to stay overnight working, or work until 1/2am, and this is deemed normal... dont expect anyone to be sympathetic that you missed your kids first dance. Recent pay gap survey showed that there is a 14% difference in pay between women and men . 3M said this was good enough and progressive. I can only speak for my own career but I have found that people who are 'yes' men/women get further. I'm sure this would be something denied, but ive been with 3M over 15 years now! As soon as you get to a certain level... there are only middle aged men in 3M. They've all been in their positions for 30+ years.

Incompetent management at all levels within corporate marketing. New leadership in April announced that 3M is now a ""digital company"" in the same way that Google is a digital company without any change to organizational structure or staffing. The entire digital ""strategy"" can be summed up by endless repetition by management of the words ""agile,"" ""SEO,"" and ""governance."" There is no understanding of what those words mean or how they would be relevant for a large manufacturing company with a massive unnavigable catalog-based website. Even within 3M, the website is viewed as a joke and instead of hiring digital professionals to fix it, boomer-aged engineers are shifted sideways into leadership roles where they (unsuccessfully) guess at how the internet works and refuse to listen to anyone that tells them otherwise. Any attempts at education are a waste of breath as the entire entire corporate structure is dead weight that know they won't be fired as there is zero accountability.

"Production Operator in Nevada, MO",3,2016-12-15T00:00:00.000Z,13018239,"Safe Place, Good Pay, HORRIBLE Management  Pay and benefits are nice, frequent breaks (every 2 hours if working a 12 hour shift), paid lunch/breaks, sick pay and personal holidays, safety is drilled into employee's heads, highly trained ERT (Emergency Response Team), and good security.  Management is ""Superior"" to all, as in they are holier than art thou. Hated working under the plant manager who was present during my employment in 2012-2015 and HR went to crap. They will walk you out of the plant/fire you over the dumbest things (even for so much as uttering a curse word), they've taken away profit sharing, forced 401K of 6% or you can't have it, and it felt like they quit fighting for decent priced insurance. Also, no pension. You put into your 401K or nothing when you retire. 3M has scaled way back on bonuses offered to employees and hires/shuffles around horrible management. You can almost guarantee whoever your supervisor is has no clue what the actual job is of those they are supervising, as in they've never done the job so you could lie and say something takes you twice the time to screw around or you could say it takes half the time and do a really crappy job. If you don't do your work, management will more than likely just force one of your co-workers to do it (one of the grunt workers) because none of them have a spine to speak to those who defy them. You must also have a certain last name to gain any recognition to move up. If your nose isn't brown, you can stay the low man on the totem pole. Also HR isn't there for employees; they're there for ""the company"" so they do no wrong because it's the ""employees"". Advice to Management:Hire better management including more effective HR, enforce fair practices, stop showing favoritism, and make group leaders more accountable. Also, give the employees back their pensions, stop the forced 6% of the 401K (let them put it 3% if they want), and for God's sake, let them smoke.

When a worker did an exceptionally good job, his/her would hand out a PRIDE ticket which has a money value of $5 per ticket. The worker then use the PRIDE ticket to exchange for an 3M item(s) on 3M Employee Store. Or, he/she can use 2 of the PRIDE tickets ( worth $10) to exchange for 2 SMALL PIECES of pizza. If one prefers the first type of exchange (to get the 3M's item/items), good luck.

They appear to work hard to find positions for their employees when layoffs or reorgs occur, and there are still a lot of people at 3M who've been here for decades, which I find amazing and also to their credit. Once you're in, you're taken care of. Also, for the most part, when I said I needed something - equipment, hardware, software - It been provided. They seem to get people what they need to do their job well, in this regard.  Until recently, 3M had many employees who had been working as contractors for many years. They've changed their policy around term limits, and many of my peers have been moved into direct-hire positions, which, to me shows a recognition of the talent they have in their ranks, so that's a bit of pro...

Culture of fear for employees older than about 45 and on pension plan 1. Productivity is terrible. The company does a good job of hiding it. In my former lab, 69% of all employees job-eliminated were 50 or older. It is justified by fitting the demographics of the lab but not the corporation. Targeting an area staffed heavily with older employees amounts to ageism by default. - Estimates are that about 50% of all current employees will experience at least one job elimination during their tenure - Job eliminations by project and not performance; history of excellent performance does not help - Pay was about 12% less than industry average for my field - 3M underpays colludes with peer companies to set salary levels. This is legal because they do it using grouped data through a consulting firm and not company-to-company. 3M underpays relative to the center of the distribution for its peer companies - Millennials in certain disciplines leave after 3-5 years due to low pay and scant promotions - At risk pay is forced on employees who have no business or R&D strategy or program selection decision-making power. At risk pay is included as a percentage of their base salary and not as a bonus - Incompetent managers placed by Jim McNerney are entrenched at senior levels. McNerney may have failed to destroy the culture of innovation at 3M, but his legacy is carrying it out effectively - R&D and product development is being managed by executives, including the CEO, who have no clue how they work - CEO wants to measure the return on investment in R&D. The answer is easy. EVERY product 3M makes and sells came from R&D either internally or by acquisition. - Promotions depend highly on your management and business unit success. - Management is promoted based on ""potential"" and technical workers are promoted based on results. Advice to Management:- Stop managing staff by job eliminations. If you must cut staff, do so by performance and not project - Eliminate pay at risk for all non-executives - Pay above the mean and median for your peer companies - If you want to consider digitization then you have to pay like companies outside your peer group - Compared with high tech companies 3M is not spending much on R&D at all.

Procedures are poor and management is unwilling to change. This company is well below industry practices when it comes to maintaining compliance. They do as little possible and documentation trail is really poor. Management culture takes recognition from people rather than recognizing direct reports. No empowerment to work harder. Just keep doing the same thing over and over. They definitely enable each other's poor performance and do not recognize individual performers.

Prior to 3M ownership, our plant had straight shifts, sick time, bonuses for perfect attendance, and very little mandatory overtime. Now we work rotating 12 hour shifts that make family life difficult, employees are forced to use vacation time when sick (3M will deny this but the system is so rigged that it is vitually impossible to call in sick without accruing disciplinary points - your doctor has to fill out a mountain of paperwork verifying that you could not perform your job duties and if submitted in time, is hardly ever approved), time in and time out has no flexibility making communication difficult and staff was cut, overtime is not only built into the schedule but demanded regularly as well as working holidays, and you must also burn up vacation to take off on a holiday. 3M claims to have a week of ""Other Paid Absences"" which looks good in theory but again employees are given disciplinary points so it's a dangling carrot. Nearly weekly reminders that you must make another sacrifice for ""The Big 3M"". Opportunity for promotions is laid out in theory, but impossible to achieve - the ""certification tests"" for promotion do not exist. In summary, 3M is a good place to make money but throw away your life, family, and self-dignity. Advice to Management:Respect for and a meaningful shift differential for those working twelves and overnight shifts. Stop forcing employees to use vacation time for sick days or holidays. Stop tellling employees that they are lucky to have more days off by working twelves (we give up more actual hours of our life). Stop pretending you're the greatest place to work because you pay well.

Technology and Innovation are at the core for whatever product you work on at 3M. The company has some of the best benefits packages, in fact they have reduced some benefits in the recent past, but are still better than most companies. Businesses are organized into Labs, which is good for having a customer focus. Yearly reviews are good and your manager typically let you know how you could contribute more. You will develop wonderful domain knowledge as the work naturally becomes solving a defined problem in the real world.  It's a huge conglomerate with literally thousands of products. In my opinion, 3M failed to develop positive working relationship within different divisions and product groups. For ex., let's say you have to lay off a s/w engineer because that group is not doing so well. You won't see the HR and the management helping the employee to find the job in another division. This happens even when the other division actually has a open job requisition. This is my only reason for giving this company a 4 instead of 5. It's basically ridiculous because the next door division doesn't value the work you do. Advice to Management:1. Have the higher management involve more in the technical work. For ex, I see Technical Directors don't even know all the projects and product platforms their division is involved in. They become so non-technical, only number crunchers, for ex like a marketer.

"Supply Chain Analyst in Saint Paul, MN",3,2015-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,8850573,"Good Company, but Out of Touch  The pay is competitive and the workload is manageable. Because the company is so large and diversified, there are a lot of opportunities to work in different industries and in different roles. Average tenure at 3M is incredibly long (it's not uncommon for employees to have 30+ years at 3M) which I think speaks to the ability to have a career with a lot of variety all at one company. Additionally, there is a strong culture of learning and development. There are constantly seminars and forums for employees to engage in continuous learning and there is generally an enthusiasm around collaboration and continuous improvement.  3M is largely behind other local Fortune 500 companies in terms of benefits for working parents. If you are thinking about accepting a position at 3M and have a family or are considering starting a family in the next 5 years, I would strongly encourage you to discern whether or not you have the financial means to take an unpaid FMLA and/or use all of your vacation time for parenting leave. For maternity leave, you are eligible for 6 - 8 weeks (depending on the type of delivery) of short term disability and any additional time must be taken unpaid. The short term disability benefit varies by years of service, but for most people I know around the office who are expecting they will receive one week of full pay (provided they don't use any sick days in the last 12 months) and 60% pay for the 6-8 weeks. Any leave a new mother wants to take beyond that is unpaid. In the worst case, if a woman must go on bedrest before leave, her family stands to take a huge financial hit. For paternity leave, the official policy of 3m is that one day can be used for the day of the birth. If a father would like to take parenting leave, he can either use vacation or take FMLA unpaid. These policies are in stark contrast to what other local Fortune 500 companies offer (Target recently announced two weeks paid paternity leave and has updated their maternity leave benefits for 2016, Thomson Reuters has 12 weeks paid for maternity and 2 weeks for paternity, UnitedHealth Group also offers 12 weeks paid for maternity leave, Best Buy offers 5 weeks paid for maternity). Additionally, only two weeks of paid vacation is offered to new employees in contrast to other competitors that offer three weeks (Boston Scientific, Target, TR, UnitedHealth Group). Lastly, despite a corporate initiative called ""Flex-Ability"", working from home is still a faux pax and you need to convince supervisors that it can be more productive and often essential to balance the needs of work and home. There is still a strong culture of ""butts in seats"". In an age where companies are acknowledging that employees are retained and more productive when they are able to balance their priorities at work and home, it seems short sighted that 3M likes to boast a competitive compensation package as well as a great company for women when its policies so clearly state the opposite. Advice to Management:It's no secret that the employee base at 3M is aging and many people are retiring. If the company wants to attract new talent, they need to make dramatic changes to parenting leave, vacation, and work accommodations. We live in a day and age where we're increasingly connected and work doesn't need to happen within the hours of 9 - 5 and in a 6x6 cube. Additionally, younger employees increasingly look for jobs that allow emoployees to be good stewards of their company and good parents.

Great pay for the area. That's about it.  SHIFT WORK! WORK/LIFE BALANCE.. Depending on which department you may work in your shift constantly changes. The last department I was in we rotated shifts every week. 1 week of days, then evenings and then grave yard. I knew what I was getting into when I applied but the OT board is what kills you. It's easy enough, if you want OT then you sign the board and if you don't then you don't sign. However there is a accumulative point system that records the number of OT hours offered vs worked. So if no one signs the board whoever has the lowest # of worked hours has to do it regardless of whatever plans you may have for when you get off work. You don't find out if you have to work until your 1/2 way through the shift. It's hard to plan things when your not sure if you will have to work or not. Also they have a point system in regards to punishment. The system escalates from 1-5. No big deal. However one of the most insane things I've ever encountered is being punished for being sick. If you call in sick you get a point for missing the day. But if you stay out 3 days and come in with a DR's note there's no punishment. I just don't get it.

You are expected to work when they want you to. Work scheduling can change depending on ""business needs!"" Expect anything from rotating shift work days-afternoons-nights, to alternating 12's going from days to nights twice per week. They claim to be ""health oriented"" but fail when it comes to understanding health consequences of alternating days/nights and lots of overtime. Mandatory overtime often means long stretches of work without a day off, but this depends on the area and time of year. Do not be expect to be recognized for achievements. The smallest policy violations can lead to poor reviews which inhibit your ability to advance and there is no appeals process that represents the employee. If you disagree with management decisions, an HR rep is assigned to represent you in the process and you are not allowed to attend the appeals decision meetings to speak for yourself. Input from supervisors and managers take precedence over that of employees. The investigation process is extremely biased toward management and does not function objectively. College tuition reimbursement DOES NOT APPLY to production workers. Advice to Management:Stop using the excuse ""the rules come from corporate headquarters."" 3M sites have rules and regulations specific for the culture, location, and function of the facility. Using this excuse underlies the lack of negotiation and people skills this site is well-known for with employees both current and former.

No one on the ground treats contractors any different than 3Mers. Culture varies a lot by group (it's a huge company after all). My group was great, very relaxed and friendly atmosphere.  Hopefully you got a job that interests you because there is little to no chance at advancement as a contract employee.

Since most management positions change every 2-5 years you are pretty much guaranteed to be chasing the full-time conversion for 3-6 years, but really it is never guaranteed and I promise you they will try to low-ball you on the offer (make sure you take those years to learn the pay scales and pay attention to min/max/market).

Very friendly people. Lots of resources to use for projects (if allotted) but many other perks of having a lot of people in a company. 401k matching and stable stock.

Famous, well-positioned company that looks good on a resume.  VERY corporate environment. Company is too big, positions overlap. I was hired as a temp, and I was pulled aside by my manager whom told me that I would continue on the project until June, instead of April. On March 30th, my badge didn't work when I went to exit the building. Security then asked for my badge. I knew that something was up. That had never happened. I contacted both the temp agency, as well as my manager to inquire why my badge had been taken away. BOTH my manager and the temp agency IGNORED me on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; ONLY calling me on Monday to tell me that I was being let go. Fine if you want to dismiss somebody off a job, but at least tell them what is going on and be adult about it.

"Interactive Marketing in Maplewood, MN",2,2011-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,911352,"Strange company, level of internal politics and negativity stifling.  If you are coming in to 3M with previous digital expertise, you will notice immediately the need to educate your peers, which can be a good thing, and can become taxing. My particular manager seemed to never be there, so working flex hours was not an issue, but can't speak to other teams. The work load was not too extensive for me, but that may have been due to the in-fighting across teams that allowed very little to get assigned and done. They had a decent web mail client, which, given managers' propensity to answer and send all emails after 8pm was a life saver.  I would not know where to start here. Most employees have been there for 10-20+ years, so this particular division did not take kindly to outsiders. The in-fighting between teams was so extensive that I was given a list of people to ""not respond to via email or phone."" I was also told not to attend meetings without approval from my manager to ensure my expertise was not ""stolen"" by ""the enemy."" Yuck. I was closed off from projects I offered the most seasoned expertise in, due to senior leadership very much disliking each other. It was disappointing to not get to leverage my expertise in an arena that so badly needed it, and the constant back-stabbing and bad-mouthing of co-workers that started on day one and never stopped made me very uncomfortable. Also, I was constantly asked to tap my network of digital vendors, agencies and resources to produce RFPs or work for 3M at the 11th hour that never went anywhere. Great way to ruin long-standing working relationships outside of the company. I was not aware of anyone who seemed ""happy"" working there compared to other companies I have worked for. No one smiled, ever. I finally had to start working on projects without telling my manager just to ensure I was doing anything at all and that I was helping them from spending way too much for way too little or just simply doing something not aligned with their audience/customer needs. From a sheer ""company"" perspective, the oddities at 3M Healthcare were endless. There were no refrigerators for employees to store lunch, beverages, etc. It may not sound like a big deal - try it sometime. The lunchroom was open very briefly every day, and offered the worst, most unhealthy and expensive selection of food (if you got there in time to get any) I have ever seen, anywhere. To avoid waste, they provided less food than needed, and anything edible was gone immediately. There's nothing but fast food around there, so going off-site was not a better option. I spent my first three days literally sitting in an empty cube with no computer (which can be typical) but also with nothing to read, ramp-up on, or anyone coming by to say hello or get me situated, manager included. I had to train myself on all systems and getting logins to do so was far more frustrating and time-consuming than usual. The commute is horrid, too, unless you live out that way. There was no discernible process to anything, and trying to instill any was futile. I had to ask folks many times for things they'd promised to deliver, to little avail. I never really knew what I was supposed to be working on, what would come up as ""due"" at any time, or what would be summarily cancelled or taken off my plate - all of this was due to politics. I spent more time in meetings about projects that never moved forward (or that at least our team was ""kicked off of"") than in meetings about viable projects. I attempted to address all of these issues over and over, to no result, and ended up having to print and save the nasty emails between teams their managers to ensure I was never ""blamed"" for something I was not involved in. Not fun. It might be fine for folks that have been there forever, and other divisions may be more advanced in their collaboration and politicking skills not to mention digital savvy. I didn't stay long enough to find out. I actually saw one person start and quit within a week while I was there. If you offer valuable expertise and have worked for other companies be ready for a massive culture shock. Advice to Management:Play nicely, and serve the customer, not your egos, infighting or chest-beating. Leverage expertise that you did not previously have internally when it is offered to you. Stop talking badly about other managers to their team members, and do not slight their team members or discount their expertise due to your own upper-level politics. Plan, and then follow through. Work smart, not hard, and use the proper vendors/agencies for what you are trying to accomplish, rather than agencies you are ""friends with"" who may not have the skills needed to do the job. If you are going to swear and talk badly of others, close your office door. Sitting outside your office and hearing it all day is not fun and quickly lowers morale. DOn't spend a team status meeting taklking badly of other teams/managers. Realize that a nice mix of 3M-seasoned managers, and managers from other companies is a GOOD thing, not a competition.",0.44676666666666653,0.015293993506493506,positive

I am trusted to do my work and 'put in the hours"" (45+) on average. No body is looking over your shoulder to make sure and this leads to an environment where people feel appreciated and willing to go the extra mile when needed. People of all types work here and I have not seen nor heard of any of the types of racial/other discrimination that a few other reviewers talked about. My guess is that if they are not advancing, they either have a poisonous attitude or are not performing as well as they think they are. One of my favorite parts of working in the technical community here is the copious amounts of learning opportunities, whether it be a Tech Forum class, a cold call to any researcher no matter how senior, or general networking. For one who likes to learn and build/contribute on others' knowledge, there is no better place to work than 3M that I know of.  If you think that just showing up is 80% of the work, this is not the place for you. Some people may slide by, but don't know how they live with themselves. Bureaucratic red tape is a fact of life in a large entity like 3M. Not fun, but one learns to work effectively within that framework.

Anonymous Employee,1,2010-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,475935,"The land before diversity. The 1950's are alive and well and living in Minnesota.  Diversity in geography, products and markets helps the company weather financial storms better than many corporations. Employment is relatively stable and it's better than being unemployed.  If you're male and white, you're in heaven here. If you're not both, it's an exercise in futility. Save your time and your sanity. If you're black, you will never go anywhere here. There are virtually no black executives, almost no black middle managers, virtually no black representation even in human resources and/or ""diversity management"". There are no diversity initiatives. Equal pay for equal work does not exist, color-wise or gender-wise. Pay for performance does not exist. It's good old boys tapping good old boys on each others' shoulders. If you're particularly talented, you can be sure that you will be kept buried and muzzled deep within the bowels of the organization. Frustration and/or exit are the only logical results. Advice to Management:The best talent resides in a diversity of people. New markets and new innovations are often best seen by looking at input from a variety of vantage points. Systemically disengaging everyone who is not a ""good old boy"" hinders growth. It also poorly positions the company for the inevitable future of an increasingly diverse society. It's obvious that there is no support for diversity at the top. This attitude permeates the entire organization. For above average growth to be generated, looking beyond the usual places and the usual suspects must occur. Challenge management to include a diverse slate of candidates for every promotion and, in particular, every management position. Integrate. Innovate. Tap change agents within the organization. You'd be amazed at how much hidden talent exists, duct-taped and handcuffed within the company. Unleash these folks and see a ground swell of new growth and creative solutions to old problems.

Good name recognition when calling on customers, however, all too often, Some quality products and quite a few quality employees are still left, but they are getting frustraited and will likely leave soon, given the opportunity.  Overall poor product line management - marketing personnel turnover is too quick resulting in lack of true understanding of customers and very importantly, not being held accountable for poor decisions made that sales people have to live with, resulting in very upset customers. Poor shipping and support causes customer frustration - management turnover is so frequent that they do not understand or develop long term relationships with key customers, as a result, they appear to make short term decisions that may help the bottom line for a year, but really harm the bottom line in future years and also harm customer relationships. Extrememly poor training, used to train sales people in one way or another every year, now, good luck with getting any real training. Advice to Management:Invest in your employees, stop milking the experienced ones and then running them off. Used to, 3M paid slightly higher than average wages/benefits, but no longer - as a result, employees are no longer willing to put up with the severe BS - you pay for mediocre, you get mediocre, not the top performers you used to get.

If the company exceeds their plan, you get a bigger payout. If they have a rough year, you get less or maybe not anything at all if it is really bad. But beware their trickery! This year they changed it from US & International sales to solely US sales. International was the bulk of business, so they found a way to pay their employees less. New changes to their vacation policy are also upsetting. All vacation is given at the beginning of the year and must be used by Dec 31st, or it disappears. Problem is, some years the plants will close down at Christmas so everybody saves their vacation until the end of the year. Then when end-of-the-year orders come through, everybody has to work.

Everyone that works at 3M is generally happy, and have been with the company for a long time. 3M creates a nice work life balance, and generally promotes managers who have good people skills, and genuinely care about their employees. 3M has deep pockets, and can do somethings that other companies might not be able to do as far as discounting products, and providing technical and sample support which can really help a sales rep win in the field. Marketing also does a nice job of communicating with the sales reps. Overall, 3M really is a great place to work, and morale is generally very high.  When I worked for 3m they had just got done going through a lot of changes (guided by Jim McNerney and Six Sigma) that cut a lot of the innovative side of the business out of 3M. The effect that this had (in my opinion) is that a lot of the ""value"" was stripped out of 3M's product offerings. What customers have come to expect from 3M is that they offer new and innovative approaches to everyday problems that customers face when manufacturing products, or performing everyday tasks necessary to keep a business running. The new CEO, George Buckley, has been playing catch-up the past few years now in order to supplant the lack of innovation by acquiring other companies. Whether this approach has worked, and or will work, remains to be seen. Advice to Management:The view that the majority of sales reps had was that the senior management was always trying to find ways to hold sales reps back from being compensated on the commission piece of their compensation. I would encourage them to develop a council (that includes senior and junior sales reps) that helps to create a more fair and motivating system of compensation.",0.5629598930481282,0.2578556149732621,positive

 Since the acquisition of KCI, there have been many changes &amp; not for the better. There is no sense of urgency when it comes to getting things done.

Engineer,2,2022-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,63476748,"Culture needs updating  Brand recognition, good salary&amp; stable company
 There are two cultures happening. The first, is initiatives put forth by corporate of how the culture should be. I see this happening between colleagues, but not within the reporting structures. 

The second is the actual culture. It is dictated by 3Mers 20 year +. If youre a new 3Mer, find one of these colleagues. Otherwise youll step over invisible lines that youre not supposed to cross. So much of it is unspoken and you should just know. 

Unfortunately, all Ive seen with Management is rude pettiness. So many do not have the skills to be a good leader. They are very rude to anyone beneath them. In general, the culture feels like its stuck in the 80s. 

Finally, I have never seen so much power given to one Manager. If your Manager is not prepared to manage people, your professional life will suffer. HR can only advise them. Legal can only advise them. Its insanity, and Ive never seen that at any other organization:
Advice to Management:Take a good hard look at your culture created by tenured employees. It certainly is not helping all the new external talent that is entering 3M.

"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN",3,2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z,76262129,"Change is the constant  Diverse product portfolios and business groups lead to a breadth of business opportunities that could allow someone to spend their entire career with one company while presenting them with experiences in a variety of markets (Consumer, Safety, Industrial, Electronics, etc.). Core Benefits are solid (Medical, Dental, Vision, etc.), but don't expect any cool perks you might find at SaaS or Consulting companies (Sports tickets, unlimited PTO, free branded merchandise/swag, networking events, Presidents club, consistent sales incentive trips).  3M has a growth problem due to its internal complexities leading to often times a poor customer experience, an indirect model that makes it difficult to measure end-user sales impact and lack of product innovation which results in pushing antiquated technology/product platforms in the market at a premium price in comparison with competition. In addition to the growth problems, multiple lawsuits loom over the company. From a sales standpoint, the variable compensation system in the U.S. is too complex. Managers and Reps are often times unable to explain it, which is a problem.

Upper management seems lost, implementing large-scale restructuring every 1-2 years keeps people guessing about whether they'll have a job or not and how to navigate new corporate structures and systems. Benefits have slowly been eroded over the years. Employees are stuck using antiquated software and systems to do basic daily tasks, which kills productivity and require technical support frequently. Advice to Management:""As our business grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to delegate responsibility and to encourage men and women to exercise their initiative. This requires considerable tolerance. Those men and women, to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if they are good people, are going to want to do their jobs in their own way. Mistakes will be made. But if a person is essentially right, the mistakes he or she makes are not as serious in the long run as the mistakes management will make if it undertakes to tell those in authority exactly how they must do their jobs. Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made kills initiative. And its essential that we have many people with initiative if we are to continue to grow.

The challenging part is navigating the stubborn, lazy, or those who simply do not care (why do they work here?).  - Quality has taken a back seat to speed. - Lower and middle management are not held accountable for shipping poor product, nor ensuring operators are trained properly and with consistency (contrary to the perception from upper management). - The strongest production employees are not usually selected for development and advancement. Same goes for salaried into management roles. Advice to Management:Why would you eliminate the position of any employee who, through their innovation and execution, has been able to save the company $2-5MM each year for several years? Why would you not promote or offer them a different position? For upper management, realize when disconnected decision-making is taking place amongst your organization. Get to know the people in your organization. You would be foolish to limit your level of communication to your direct reports, while expecting the whole truth and nothing but.

As a result, you find yourself surrounded with excellent and knowledgeable people who know how to get things done in the company and are committed to their roles.  3M's top leadership and BOD's commitment to their strategy, initiatives, and people has suffered greatly since about 2015. The company has fallen on hard times financially and has replaced much of its highly talented leadership with outsiders who do not understand how to make the company successful. They have come to rely on consultants to come in and sell them a bill of goods on what needs to be done only to discover that the recommendations are infeasible to actually carry out within the time and budget allocated. Instead of retooling and working it out, leadership rather conducts yet another reorganization and lays off thousands of good and talented people. They've lost the reigns and do not know how to operate a large, diversified company whose strong suit of product and technology innnovations has been lost. Very sad to see a previously great company falter as 3M has. Advice to Management:Return to your roots of innovative product development to get that pipeline opened back up, promote your top talent into important roles and rely on them to get the company back on course, stop hiring consulting firms that misguide your decision making, develop your strategic plans and stick to them.

Sophisticated Risk-Management and U.S. tax-advantaged policies with an indirect benefit of secure and safe employment during pandemics. 3. Accessibility to a global library of Best Business Practices and methodology. 4. High attrition rate of top performers and disgruntled employees affords advancement opportunities for a younger generation and friends of upper management. 5. A great place to 9-to-5 towards retirement... if that's your thing.  1. Clunky behemoth with weak transformation to digital-age opportunity capture. 2. Fluffy organizational management poor at Better Business Practices and continuous improvement. 3. A trickle-down lack of genuine accountability means declining corporate value to loyal employees and consumer relations. 4. A short-term company for long-term career impact. Support and progress are too slow for merit-based performance. Advice to Management:I get it... the damage is already done. Overdue industrial-age lawsuits in the military, healthcare, and environmental spaces plus lagging pivot to post-pandemic supply chain resilience and information-age transformation all underscore the short-term quarterly decisions of a large public company. So, we can't completely blame senior management (notice I didn't use the word ""leadership""). However, we can remind ourselves that an unyielding focus on the consumer should supersede the organizational default to produce more... more manufactured products, more marketing collateral, more vapid human resource management, more wasteful meetings all irrelevant to consumer needs and employee purpose. An evolution to authentic leadership with confident humility, active customer engagement, and an accountable approach to talent development may serve 3M and SpinCo well and consumers even better.

I worked in MSD (Medical Solutions Division) - I was able to meet some great people - Worked on some pretty cool projects with clients - Was given the remote flexibility that everyone wants in their work.  Oh boy. Where do I start.. There is A TON of change in the company, so it was quite volatile towards my ending in August, 2023. They were just getting to spin-off the MSD into a separate company and there wasn't much confidence that this new company would be ready by it's launch date of January 1st. Secondly, moral was low the entire year of 2023 due to waves of layoffs and the updates with the PFAS litigations. The culture was starting to get toxic for a while there, where multiple leaders I knew left and jumped ship to other companies. They likely were seeing the writing on the wall. To top it all off, the investors are seeing this and it has been reflected in 3M's stock market value. Advice to Management:Nothing for management.

Hard work is only rewarded by more work and responsibilities with out a pay raise or promotion - impossible to get a promotion if your supervisor/management has any personal issues with you, despite if your performance and regular job duties go above and beyond your current job grade. You are expected to work at the level above your pay grade to ""prove"" you are capable, when even when you do this, the goal posts keep getting moved. Promotions from group to group vary so widely, there is no standardized approach to promotions which lead to rampant nepotism. - HR is only there to protect the company and management. It doesn't matter if your management violated the code of conduct and you provided proof that this was happening. You stick your neck out to do the right thing, and then when HR does nothing, you then have a huge target on your back from your management who then continues to undermine you in more covert ways. And then HR ignores when you are targeted for retaliation. - morale is terrible and will only continue to get worse. Unless there are huge changes within 3M within the next 6 months (and not just ""restructuring"" lay-offs that seem to have no rhyme or reason), I do not see how this will get any better. - psychologically an unsafe place to work. abuse and bullying from management is tolerated. HR will do nothing. - if you care about your mental health or job security, steer clear of this company. Advice to Management:there needs to be accountability in management. Supervisors, managers, directors, VPs, etc are all apparently untouchable and do not get any feedback from direct reports on how well they do their jobs.
