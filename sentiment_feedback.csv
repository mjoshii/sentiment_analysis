"No training, then to the wolves you go",Operator,"Pros:Only the pay was good. That's it. Cons:Absolutely minimum training. Then if you make a mistake, even as a trainee, you're on the chopping block. Which is a lot of stress and adds to why they can't keep people and have constant mandatory overtime. Morale is at an all time low. Have you ever wondered what it's like to be harrassed because you're a woman? And then the harrasser still works there after turning it in because ""they're a good employee ""! Look no further, I have the place for you! Did I mention that if you snap back at your harrasser, YOU get a final warning? They leave your training up to you. Need to learn to drive a forklift? Up to you. If you dont get it done or are unsure, terminaton awaits you. New and unsure where to find items for stocking? People have eyes for a reason! Out you go! There's expectations and then there's just absolute overkill. It's so sad that it's almost comical. They tell you that your job is very important and not to make mistakes but you don't have the training needed to avoid these mistakes. Then you fall into the trap of getting fired for ""poor performance "" It's certainly hard to perform if you can't get any training for your job! If you say something about it, they'll say that they gave you the bits and pieces and now it's up to you to make your career! I'd say that expecting trainees to do a job perfectly without training is certainly ambitious! Did I say poor work life balance? 6 days a week. Some people hardly ever leave. Most people in that plant are stuck in the old ways of working until they drop dead. Advice to Management:Stop expecting people to train themselves and actually provide the basic training that's needed for the job you hire them for. Hold employees accountable for workplace harassment, no matter how long they've been there or how good of an employee they are. Trainees are trainees for a reason. They should be corrected if mistakes happen, not fired.",1,2022-12-28T00:00:00.000Z,72167700

Do Not Work Here.,"Research Scientist in Decatur, IL","Pros:They pay you money for your work. Cons:Attitudes everywhere, higher level scientists act like you're an ant and certain scientists look down on you just for being a contractor. They expect you to work like a hired-on scientist and help their research advance without giving you benefits or respect of being an ADM scientist. If you do only what your contracted to do- that's not enough. Be expected to give presentations and to give input at group meetings even if you barely know the experiment since you just started on it- as well as not even knowing how long they'll keep you around. Very weird expectations. I was working the small-scale fermentation team and was doing well, a sanitation specialist, who thinks he's a scientist there, lied about how I disposed of acid, something he asked me do and he was responsible of (and something outside of my contractual obligation) and they ended my contract immediately with no conversation with me about the situation. They went completely off of whatever this person said and ended my 8 month contract after 6 months. While I was there, I helped decrease the error bars found in their results, collect accurate data in a timely manner, some days I would be sampling 100% by myself while other scientists were at their desks or calling off of work, and TRAINED another contractor. All in 6 months. But apparently I was ""unsafe in the lab"" and that nullified all of that great work performance. But it was a blessing in disguise, while working there I found out they keep contractors on contract for 1-2+ years before hiring them in, that means you receive no benefits from ADM while working there and they dangle employment over your head like bait. One contractor was hired in as I became a contractor and she would occasionally joke about wanting to be fired to be re-hired as a contractor due to the high workload they dropped on her head each week. A higher scientist I worked with does so much each week and they wont promote him to a higher position because he's too good at what he does at that position and use the fact he doesn't have a Masters/PhD as an excuse. Not even a raise. He's been there for five years. The lab environment is messy, random liquids in random beakers unlabeled for days even YEARS (in a microbe lab?!). I would ask PhDs to clean up after themselves, these same scientists would ask me questions about instrument operation- I watched my supervisor yell at us about sampling errors and then when she did it ASKED ME how to sample! Scientists push you off of instruments you're working on or stare you down as you use it until you're done. The lab's ceiling tile is constantly under repair, by the time I left there was a weird tent-funnel system set up to catch liquid out of the roof due to tile replacement. It wasn't until my new lab position that I realized how unsafe and abnormal that actually was. Unless you really want to get into fermentation science, avoid working here. Decatur smells like feces somedays, trains are constantly stopping on tracks forcing you to find a way around. The workers there are very cliquey, I felt like I had a two-day window to be socially accepted or not (I was not), and obviously some are respected more than others. There are other labs and industries that dont have their nose so high up. It's sad to see one of the largest American companies in the world functions this way. Advice to Management:If there is an issue or a statement from one of your employees about a contractor, get both sides of the story. Don't just end the contract without any explanation from the contractor on why an employee may say what they did. Also, make it clear what the path of becoming a permanent employee entails- don't just keep saying ""you're doing great"" at each one-on-one and all of a sudden end their contract because of some janitor, basically.",1,2022-09-09T00:00:00.000Z,68898481

"Culture rife with politics, nepotism and favoritism","Anonymous Employee in Erlanger, KY","Pros:Good pay, great and inexpensive benefits.

People will routinely introduce themselves as so-and-so’s son/daughter, so-and-so’s kid’s best friend, so-and-so’s gym buddy. People with powerful connections will rise rapidly and despite obvious incompetence. Pay is hugely disparate.

Very much a middle-school environment of the kids in the inner circles vs. the outsiders. Casual racism and sexism is sprinkled through the conversation of management.

Its a 3 shift rotation with 8 hour shifts. They work us 7 days in a row on each shift, with about a day in between each shift and the only time we get a decent amount of time off is at the end of the rotation, we get a 5 day break. It's the WORST schedule, its hard to even have a life outside of work, and to make it even worse, if someone calls in you are required to stay an additional 4 hours to cover that shift, sometimes not even being notified until the last minute of your shift that you will have to stay. We were promised a better 12 hour rotation schedule that would give us a work 3 days, 2 days off and work 2 days, 3 days off, which every single employee unanimously voted yes for, but its just been constant excuses of why they can't switch to the new schedule, which if they did, would make this review a lot more positive Advice to Management:I think management should listen to their employees more often and take their suggestions into consideration.

A self-serving company that positions employees dead last,"Accountant in Decatur, IL","Pros:The company offers great benefits. Unfortunately, that's where the positives stop. Cons:I left of my own accord after 12 years. As an accountant, I saw the bonuses reaped from upper management while employee-focused social functions, bonuses, and even Christmas parties were cut. The company has begun outsourcing. I.T. was outsourced a few years ago. In 2021 and 2022, Accounting functions were outsourced. They claimed it wasn't outsourcing, but a strategic partner. However, that was not the case. Morale was low and many left. I was told I would lose my position in the coming year. It was literally that arbitrary. They couldn't give me a date or time period. In order to receive severance I had to stay on board to train my overseas replacement and as long as I was needed. I did not stick around. Management often forms their reviews to alott only certain high marks to limit the number of ""higher raises"" given out each year at review time. I worked two jobs and kept both desks afloat for months until I could train and supervise a new hire. I was given a poor review with no mention of my extended duties beyond my job. I was also given supervisory duties over two employees which I held for 2 years. I could not be given the title, however, because a pay bump wasn't approved. This happened to another person in my group, also. I performed the work of a supervisor without the title or pay. Bottom line, ADM only cares about margins.

Toxic Work Environment,"Quality Technician I in Sabetha, KS","Pros:Some coworkers are decent people.

Management is both ineffective and abusive. Upper management routinely retaliates against victims if they complain about the myriad of abuses that employees suffer...even though they herald their non-retaliation policy. Management is erratic and inattentive. Workers toil in unbearable heat without relief. Staffing shortages compounded by a hiring process that moves slower than a geological age, make it impossible to maintain any adequate safety or quality standards. Management is more concerned with hiding unsanitary manufacturing conditions from customers than they are with cleaning. Documentation is routinely falsified. Plant level advancement is frequently dependent upon nepotism and Quid Pro Quo relations. Upper management positions aren't rewarded based on merit...they're based on a crooked, oily favors system, that would make a 1930s Chicago politician blush. Advice to Management:Terminate every single person in a management position and start fresh.

Problems upon Problems,"Process Engineer in Decatur, IL","Pros:People were nice. I was impressed with the hiring class that I came in with in Decatur, IL. Many were smart, ambitious, and fun to be around. If you like working with your hands and a small town, this may be worth considering. Cons:I worked in the East Plant as a process engineer. I had thought I would be engineering, but I constantly had to move into supervising for months at a time on the back shifts with less than 1 days notice sometimes. My projects would be moved to others or put on pause. It was extremely frustrating to have to do this roughly about 4 times in the 3 years I was there. Another aspect that I did not like was the environment. It was dirty, hot, and quite miserable with the company constantly being very cheap and giving minimal raises. It is manufacturing so that is to be expected to some degree but there are many opportunities in cleaner and safer manufacturing plants. The pay was also quite terrible. Raises were around 2% every year with no bonuses or stock options available. They ran very bare bones so you often carried many hats but that does give good experience. It just isn't something you would probably want to do for 30 years. In my experience at the East Plant, it was often a rat race to see who could work the hardest and spend the most time in the plant as if that were something to be proud of. You can definitely get a role with decent work/life balance but don't be surprised if the role ends up sucking up all your time. Advice to Management:Give higher salaries to retain talent as there are many options out there that are far superior in geography, culture, environment, and work meaningfulness.",1,2021-08-23T00:00:00.000Z,51524960

Procurement Bait and Switch,"Buyer in Decatur, IL","Pros:As a company, ADM is taking substantial strides to improve the organization. My review is specifically for being hired into Procurement. Developing structured approach to procurement. Flexible with remote work. Taking COVID-19 seriously. As a contractor, they do not want to approve overtime, so you can count on 8-hour days - great for work/life balance. Cons:As a company, ADM is taking substantial strides to improve the organization. My review is specifically for being hired into Procurement. Within my first 30 days of working, I was told the position I was hired into has no chance of converting to an actual hired position, so 1 star for Career Opportunities. == Culture is very toxic == A 'work HARDER not smarter' attitude pervades the culture. I was directly told that if I have time to recommend improvements then I am not busy enough. In our recent all-hands, our Director suggested that 80+ hour work-week is approximately when people should begin asking for professional development. This is a culture where you will never enjoy a job well done. Our team stopped reporting being ahead of schedule because when we do management raises the standards for all future projects. Asking questions is discouraged - questions are seen as your ignorance (which reflects on your supervisor). Be prepared to justify why you need access to any information your supervisor didn't anticipate you needing. Poor communication is the norm. Being able to shut people down (""You don't need to know that"") and scheduling multiple conflicting meetings seems to be a status symbol. Meeting Hygiene is wasteful. Management routinely schedules conflicting meetings and never updates their RSVP. Usually about 10 minutes after the meeting was supposed to start the manager notifies us they are rescheduling the meeting. We wait for that message because the wrath of a manager is worth just sitting there. About 1 in 5 meetings will always run over time. If the meeting agenda is achieved early, the meeting leader will want to fill the time with unplanned discussion. You can usually be on mute for an entire meeting since they generally are people coordinating information they could have emailed. Matrix-style organization with ineffective delegation of decision authority. does not effectively delegate, so you spend 60%+ of your time waiting for people to have the time to make a decision they already feel is beneath them. Advice to Management:Teams do not understand the resources they are being asked to use. Everyone speaks in platitudes because they do not understand the operational definition of processes. This is multiplying everyone's work time-work is constantly sent back for revision because ""a real high level overview"" means something different at every level of the organization. People are scared to commit to anything because they know that tremendous resources are being spent to BLAME people while hard work gets ""rewarded"" with more hard work. Delegate decision authority to the lowest possible level. You won't be in control of every decision, and that is good. You have the tools to make sure everyone is on track.",2,2021-03-15T00:00:00.000Z,44042248

The plants are filled with unqualified temp agency associates, because you burn through permanent hires, by not allowing work/life balance. Look how much $$ you spend in temp services. Imagine spending that on more permanent associates, per shift. (Thus offering work/life balance) I spent 20 years with the company. They just didn’t get it. They put $ in bringing in “experts” to figure these things out...all for not. Or they realign and cut jobs, just in time for financials to be reported out. I learned a lot in my 20 years. A lot of what NOT to do, in order to be successful in business. Using this knowledge has grown my career to new heights. (With a work/life balance!)",3,2019-07-07T00:00:00.000Z,27840134

Cons:Too many hours due to lack of employee's, management doesn't heed the advice of those actually doing the job or is extremely slow to make appropriate and easy changes. The communication is both non-existent and of poor quality. Some supervisors treat drivers like garbage and openly run down drivers behind their back in front of other employees. Pay is below standard for industry and job duties. Putting driver facing camera's in all trucks as a babysitting tool. They say they are not going to be used as a disciplinary tool but the only reason there would need to be a driver facing camera is for the recording to be used as a disciplinary tool through coaching or write ups. either way it is a distraction to the driver and adds stress to the job.

Maintenance A since 1994,"Maintenance A in Enderlin, ND","Pros:pension is ok below average in the industry but at least one is offered. Cons:this company gives less than cost of living pay increases, and increases the employee contribution to the benefit package thus driving down your standard of living. The heath care package is poor 1million life time cap and if your heathy you will pay all of your heath care costs and typically not meet your deductible. This is by design. The management has 0 accountability , their slogan for safety is zero is possible. but should be zero is probable as anything that may occur will be blamed on the effected employee 100% of the time regardless of any circumstance. This is also by design and the reason for their belief in zero is possible , zero liability as their goal. I believe their primary concern is not the safety of the employees as much as it is to cover their liability in any situation regardless of anything else. I worked for ADM for 23 years as a maintenance A my job was to help maintain the electrical maintenance troubleshoot electrical problems and support of primarily electrical based problems in the plant. I received my Journeymans and Master electricians license while I worked there. but this company does not have electricians on staff thus my maintenance A job description. They do this so the can pay the employees less than electrician standard wages and still have them do electrical work. I would not recommend this job to anyone. I finally got fed up and left it was not hard to find a company to top what this one offered. Advice to Management:management needs to be replaced this is where fat needs to be cut. most employees I worked with are good hard working employees , the bread and butter of plant.

Corporate finance could be great but isn’t,"Anonymous Employee in Chicago, IL","Pros:Some people really are great at their jobs and managing others. Hopefully you will work for one of them. Hopefully you will work in one of the business units that really values its people and not corporate.

Cons:Unfortunately, there are managers who are knowledge experts but haven’t a clue how to properly manage teams. These people should not under any circumstance have direct reports. Upper management values stability more than actually putting a great leader in place. Management is not rewarded for developing a great team so development is not a focus. “Perception is the only thing that matters.” Direct quote from a very senior person. It doesn’t matter if in reality you are destroying value or hurting the team if simply the perception is the opposite. The route to success here is to convince the person above you that you know what you’re talking about. It doesn’t matter whether that’s actually true or not. An MBA from a top school can buy instant credibility and opportunities not afforded to those without regardless of performance.

Employee,"Professional Driver in Decatur, IL","Pros:Local, decent salary and benefits. Cons:ADM Ttucking is a wholly owned subsidiary of ADM, one of the largest agricultural processors in the world and since no one can haul your own product cheaper than you can and with the legalities of the subsidiary position, ADM Trucking is not run as an independent company but a write-off type of expense. Thus the management is mostly attitude and ego.

"Free Money, but No Inspiration Available","Engineer II in Decatur, IL","Pros:Literally the easiest money you'll make. Put in 50+ hours per week and produce nothing of value and you will never lose your job. Do the same and produce then get moved up until you are one step ahead of your capabilities. Put in 50+ hours in that position, etc etc etc. Cons:Everyone is promoted on an arbitrary basis. The pro listed above creates a considerable con - everybody is bad at their job because they are promoted based on their performance at their current job, NOT because of their potential at the job they get promoted to. Hard working engineers who are willing to put in crazy hours and forego life outside of the plant are rewarded with higher positions but make terrible managers who expect equivalent effort from their subordinates who don't have the same values. Good, productive engineers are left behind because they don't work the hours, while less than capable engineers get moved up because they are at work before their managers get to work and after their managers leave. The review system is unproductive because it is based on the amount of work done not the quality of work or the employee's ability to work with team members. There is no structured system for Engineers to move up in pay scale. There is no definition for Production Engineer, Engineer I, Engineer II, Engineer III, and Senior Engineer and these titles are arbitrarily distributed. You won't get the title unless you request it. They don't offer promotions. Really there is no inspiration to work for ADM and the longer you stay the less motivated you will be to advance. Advice to Management:Management's ability to retain talent is less than stellar. Of the 20 engineers that I started with 9 years ago 1 remains with the company. That is not an exaggeration. Management needs to stop asking 'why do we lose engineers' and start putting in the initiative and research to actually understand why. Their solution is to hire new graduates with a lucrative starting salary then squeeze every penny out of them without offering anything in return. It is a distorted way of running a business in the contemporary job landscape and unless they turn 180 degrees they will continue to bleed young talent. On a positive note, though, I think Juan Luciano is a great leader. Sadly that trickles down only to the business side of the company as opposed to the production side.",2,2016-10-30T00:00:00.000Z,12499294

Production Engineer,Production Engineer,Pros:- Opportunities to move up - Prestigious Position at the facility - Fast track to management Cons:- You have to work shift work with an engineering degree. - Work with managers who are mostly old and have an old fashion attitude with little room for you to bring innovative ideas to the table as a young individual.

Lower employees working harder and better than those above them at plant level yet the ones higher in rank do nothing and take all of the credit.

Quality Control Lab Technician,"Lab Technician in Decatur, IL","Pros:They hire recent grads without any experience, which allows them to learn skills and gain experience. Once you are hired on officially, rather than through a contract employer, they have a good health care package. Will contribute to a 401K There is regular overtime pay. Cons:It's a very rough schedule to live on. Swing shifts of 12 hours, switching from day shift to night shift every 2 weeks. The days off you do have are often determined to be on call and possible overtime shifts, but without compensation. So although you will technically have days off, you would not be able to leave town or make definitive plans in town. If you get called in and exceed 40 hours for the week, you would get overtime pay, but no pay for making yourself available even when not needed. This schedule makes it difficult to have relationships outside of work. It is a rough place to work, both environment and people. Officially harassment of any kind is not tolerated, but truly, you need to have very thick skin to be able to be there. Being the best you can be at your job isn't necessarily what the supervisors appreciate. Working hard, safely, maintaining a clean area, and being ahead of the rest of the pack when it comes to data reporting is not respected and some of (not all) the supervisors will trash talk good workers in front of other employees. This builds a lot of resentment and leads to a high turnover in employees. Advice to Management:Be respectful and find ways to show employees that they are valued, and respected. There is no need to speak condescendingly to employees. Often, you only speak to us if you believe we have done something wrong. I feel that i should state that the plant manager always makes an effort to say hello and ask how we are doing. He is my many supervisors's boss, but he seems like a decent and hard working man.",2,2016-03-08T00:00:00.000Z,9850410
Great Values,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:The company aspires to great things, wants to embrace innovation, and foster a continuous learning ethos. It has highly motivated, talented and sincere colleagues who are willing to share their experience with each other. Teamwork is highly valued and rewarded. The company was transformed over the past 10 years by new leadership. Cons:Blind devotion to ""shareholder value"" will be the Achilles heel for delivering on the leadership's aspirations. You can't close a facility, toss 80 people on the street right before Christmas and rationalize it with ""blah, blah, blah shareholder value."" Internal loyalty will be eroded by this tone deafness. Much of what they do in support of their aspirations they try to do on the cheap. Advice to Management:Dump the old school thinking, be bold, being miserly isn't a virtue.

Finance/Accounting Review,"Anonymous Employee in Decatur, IL","Pros:Decent compensation. Some departments have a laid back atmosphere. Decent vacation time. For the most part, people don't care about their job, so the best asset is to have sharp communication skills. Cons:Finance/accounting is completely separate from the commercial side at ADM, and is therefore viewed simply as a cost, and not a strategic partner. In addition, the vast majority of these positions are in Decatur, Il- if you know ANYTHING about Decatur, then that should say enough. Hence, there is minimal in career development, and a 'just here for the paycheck' mentality. If you are career-oriented and motivated, finance/accounting in ADM is not for you. If your lifestyle is more of a soccer-mom, and you don't really care that much, then it might be perfect. Advice to Management:Develop people in finance and accounting! We need more than a tiny program (FDP) that only caters to a specific one or two pretentious vice-presidents.",2,2016-01-10T00:00:00.000Z,9143487

Summer Intern - Lysine Plant,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Safety is paramount and management really made you feel that you were in good hands. Pay was great as were the benefits which included the gym and access to the corporate cafeteria. Potential to move up the food chain quickly if performance warranted it. Cons:As this was a plant, in the summers it was hot and in the winters it was cold. The full time employees were not the easiest to get along with. Advice to Management:I would say to have more than one intern working at a time. It would have been nice to have someone else around to speak with during the internship.",4,2016-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,10811461
The best way to kickstart your career in Commodities Trading,Graduate Trainee in Rotterdam,"Pros:Intense work environment, nice colleagues, great opportunities to learn. Company sends to you many courses abroad (FOSFA, NOFOTA, Trading Workshop in Switzerland etc) and urges you to network - both within the company and externally.. Absolutely fascinating to see the Panamax vessels next to the office discharging agricultural commodities. The Graduate programme requires employees to change 2-3 countries (mostly Europe) which is a unique opportunity. Cons:A lot of administrative tasks during the first months. Company still in transition of a new Information System to abolish paper work, but till then, paper is still there and is mostly handled by trainees. Just be patient and think of the potential in the company. Far from Rotterdam centre - you need a car to reach the facilities.

CFO Group,"Anonymous Employee in Decatur, IL","Pros:Note: This review is only relevant for positions within the CFO Group (Finance, accounting, internal audit & IT). ADM is a stable company and one of the top ag companies in the world. In finance and accounting, the work/life balance is manageable, and most departments are laid back. There are summer hours, and a few employee appreciation events throughout the year. In addition, the company is very stable- while the industry doesn’t have much of an upside, it has even less of a downside; everyone needs food. The commercial group (not part of CFO group) is considered amongst the best in the world for grain merchandising. Cons:The ag-industry is slow growing, has tiny margins, and doesn’t really change, hence ADM lacks a dynamic atmosphere, and more resembles an inefficient government bureaucracy. When you also consider that most CFO-group jobs are in Decatur, Il (a polluted, rundown industrial town), this leads to several negative factors: -Minimal career development. They don’t develop their own employees, so most senior-level employees are recruited from competitors who DO develop employees. -Low pay. Only top managers are eligible for any form of bonus. Salary is known to be far below industry standard. -Ancient IT systems, think 1980’s DOS system. Seriously. ADM isn’t Apple. -Brain-drain/less qualified employees. No qualified person really wants to live in Decatur. The 'leftovers' are more focused their multiple out of wedlock children and the Kardashians. -Nepotism. It’s amazing how many people have a relative that were ‘helped.’ Many many people have the same last names, and not by coincidence. Simply put, the CFO group is not for intelligent, hardworking and career-minded individuals. To further attest to ADM’s status, there have been several recent high profile departures, including the head of IT, while in the middle of a huge IT transformation project. The C-suite routinely brags about its high-margin acquisition strategy, but no tiny bolt-on purchase will really ad that much value when compared to ADM’s behemoth corn/oilseeds/grain divisions. The CFO group at ADM is a place to go for a job, for a paycheck. If you are ambitious, or want at least moderate career development, AVOID any finance/accounting job at ADM. If you are interested in a merchandising role, then ADM is definitely the right place. Advice to Management:While it is hard to change the company given the low-margin, slow growth industry, at least focus on employee development for those employees that want to make a difference.",1,2016-04-25T00:00:00.000Z,10392248

Also unheard of. This company has no relationship with their hard working employees. If you are ok with a 35 cent raise every year until you retire or die at the facility then this is the place for you. Advice to Management:Stop taking ""come from nothing"" college students and trying to mold them to the perfect Adm manager. News flash, they have never been around a grain elevator nor have they ever ran a piece of machinery ever in their life. They do not know anything about the business and should stay out.

Operations accounting perspective,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Global employer. Quality health, dental, vision, life AD&D insurance. Lots of opportunities to try different fields and live in different regions. However, most of those regions in the US are in the Midwest. Decent opportunities to move within the company, even moving between profit centers. It's a hit and miss as to which accounting departments are ""good"" departments. There are some amazing middle and lower level managers, and also some nightmarish ones. They encourage you to stay in your position for 18 months, so be aware. Decatur is a terribly disappointing city, but the cost of living can't be beat. Cons:Con's? How about: Decatur IL. Visit the city before you accept the job. Also, accounting platforms are ancient and not integrated. You think you know Excel? Baby, you haven't seen Excel in action until you've seen ADM Excel. Don't expect top tier technology with this Ag giant. ADM is working on a project to update the old and non-integrated systems, but it's expected to take a decade... or more. It's a large company that touts innovation, but somehow on the ground level (at least in accounting where I have worked) management is very stuck in its old ways. Be prepared to be overworked with unimpressive pay. If you're in operations accounting you can kiss your family goodbye for a week because of the large amounts of OT you'll work each month end. Advice to Management:For the love of all things fiscal, update the accounting platforms!

ADM is a very Safety Oriented Company that strives to continuously improve and educate all employees Contractors included.This is by a high standard of accountability to the company and for ones self by taking the time for employees to become aware of hazards in the areas they are working in. All of this is to ensure everyone goes home safely at the end of the day to their families and loved ones. They are also doing an amazing job with all the new construction over the years to make working conditions cleaner & safer for everyone whether an employee, visitor or a client. House Keeping is at the top of the list as well. Every job I have ever worked at since working at ADM I can say without hesitation I carried & carry all I have learned from ADM to all of them and all past employers and present are grateful to you. I would like to personally Thank Ron Wilson for making me do nothing but put parts away for my first 3 weeks, and telling me that in life the one thing No One can ever take from you is knowledge and knowledge becomes Wisdom only when you use it so remain teachable. Also that one learns even more when he is willing to teach others. Thanks ADM for all you taught me!!!! Cons:Cons there are not to many except for your belief in Zero accidents. I believe 98 maybe 99% of all accidents can be prevented and that most are human error. Unfortunately things do break and what can happen will happen. I have seen people targeted after an incident that wasn't even a lost time accident and fired just afterwards for something not related supposedly. It has the reputation now so people are afraid to report anything because they know what will come next. I have never had to sign a paper anywhere that I have ever worked that stated I could not hold them liable if an accident occurred and if I did not sign it I would not be hired. Though I know the ADM is 100 % safer than when I first worked there that does not give me confidence that this is a safe place to work at. I think accountability by deniability shows a lack of integrity. Myself I personally think that anyone who deals with workmans comp is in for a world of hurt for they care nothing for the victim whether one seeks legal action or not. If one does seek legal action beware because it will follow that individual. If one is careful and follows your instructions to the T and are self-disciplined to consciously be aware of where they are, identifying thoroughly on safety sheets all existing hazards in that area & appropriate course of action to removing hazards or appropriate PPE while focused to job at hand, their odds of going home without incident is a strong 99%. Safety is a team effort so strive for perfection but be realistic that 1 to 2 % cannot be prevented. I am sorry but the smell isn't all that pleasant but I did get use to it.

Superintendent,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Plenty of opportunity for young engineers. Opportunity to move between groups and divisions to find the best fit. Young engineers will be given as much responsibility as they are ready for. Cons:Once advancement begins, so to does the politics. Trust between operations and commercial groups is lacking. The culture is changing from one of innovation to ""cover your back"" and ""improve your chances by making others look bad"". Advice to Management:There are good people in the ranks - seek them out. When mid level managers start replacing people directly under them, it may be more about removing competition than improvement. Upper management has created so many levels that they have lost visibility.",3,2015-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,6800336
Great Place for Engineers to start career,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Provides many opportunities for development of engineering talent. Good benefits and great name recognition in the industry.

Analyst,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:ADM provides free iced tea and popcorn everyday. They have a great omelete bar about once a week, and the salad bar is pretty good. Cons:ADM uses very old practices and has an older management mentality. It is very hierarchical. An outsider would also be surprised as some of the basic policies that this MNC does not have. The salaries are not as high as they should be across the board. I feel that they take advantage of local people from the central Illinois area in providing these lower salaries. In addition, it is troubling to see the company move its headquarters to Chicago from Decatur. I understand to an extent the business reasons for doing this, but I am concerned that this will severely damage an already fragile economy. Decatur was the subject of a recent Wall Street Journal article describing the serious challenges. It just feels like ADM is leaving its roots and sacrificing the people of Decatur in the process. Advice to Management:Consider easing up on the intense hierarchy and look at new ideas and options. Just because you have not done it before does not mean that it would not benefit the company and its employees in the long run. Also, take a more sincere approach to environmental protection. Everyone has to complete a training on environmental stewardship, but I think this is only because it was mandated by the government due to the company's many environmental violations. ADM has a big role to play in these issues and should understand the consequences of failing to protect our natural resources. In this way, the company is short-sighted.",3,2015-05-16T00:00:00.000Z,6616586

Really nice company to grow with,"Production Engineer in Decatur, IL",Pros:There are a lot of extremely intelligent people working at the Lab and usually you can find someone with expertise in almost anything you could be working on. Cons:Raises are kind of arbitrary and really depend on how much your Group leaders want to push for you when they all get together to determine the ladder. Advice to Management:There should be a way to review management so they are getting feedback on their performance. Ensure supervisors and management are mentoring young engineers.,4,2015-02-19T00:00:00.000Z,5957037

"Great pay, benefits, and work wasn't bad.","Anonymous Employee in Decatur, IL","Pros:Great pay, great benefits, work wasn't too hard, people were pretty good to work with too. Cons:Swing shift was not easy with a family. Worked seven days of seconds, off 24 hours, work seven nights of thirds, off for 48 hours, work seven days of first shift, then you get four days out. It's not too bad when you get adjusted to it, but for me having a wife and kid, it has sucked. Management doesn't want to listen to you when you tell them that there's a problem, but when that problem gets out of hand and stops production it's the employee's fault. Safety only matters if it won't cost anything to do. If there's a problem with the tracks, and you tell your supervisor, he tells you he'll pass it up the line but keep using that track. When you keep using the track and cars derail, it's your fault because your supervisor never passed it up to management. Communication is non existent. When the superintendent comes out of his office, he doesn't know what anything is or where anything is. He will also yell at you for doing something wrong, when he doesn't know if it's wrong or right in the first place. If you take your concerns higher than him, that he doesn't know what is going on, they tell you not to worry about it. It's a very discouraging system. Advice to Management:Listen to your employees. They're trying to talk to you, trying to make the plant safer, more efficient, and raise profitability.",3,2015-05-13T00:00:00.000Z,6592100

Plenty of opportunity for advancement as mid-level traders are constantly leaving for other companies. Cons:Shareholder driven. Leaderships concern with the stock price drives nonsensical cuts and divestment which contradict ADMs core competencies. Many different divisions spend time trying to eat each other's lunch.

Good company with unusual schedule.,"Operator in Valdosta, GA",Pros:Good pay. Excellent benefits. Great insurance. Easy job. A lot of opportunity for advancement for motivated individuals. Management is good and supports you generally. Cons:It is a swing shift schedule. Shift changes every week. There is no time to adjust to a shift. There is no succession planning. If an employee quits there is required overtime to fill in that spot until a new hire is made. Takes about 2 months. Advice to Management:Build a talent pool to pull from and get replacement employees sooner. Explore new schedules and change the swing shift system to a 4 on 4 off type of schedule.,4,2015-06-30T00:00:00.000Z,7070373
Disappointed,"Management Accountant in London, England","Pros:Large company, large range of employee welfare benefits, almost guaranteed an annual pay rise and Christmas party Cons:Inconvenient and unfit for purpose office in an industrial setting. Disconnection with management who never appreciate or realise the troubles experienced. Super over-complicated inter-company structure leading to hours and hours spent resolving internal reporting differences. Despite size, opportunities to move up are surprisingly rare (given the size of the company) and those moving up the ranks are often overlooked for the 'lifers' that have been in ADM forever. Advice to Management:More appreciation of the strain placed on management accountants when they are reporting. Most of the strain originating from the lack of understanding from higher management and a totally inept financial reporting system particularly surrounding intercompany. There was a very depressed attitude in the office and I am very glad to be out of it despite it meaning that I am no longer in a billion dollar company.",2,2015-06-02T00:00:00.000Z,6770630

Lots of opportunities to demonstrate your work and to proof your skills from the Billion Dollar challenge. Company/Corporate values are promoted from within to encourage cross functional teamwork among colleagues and management. One good example is the heavy emphasis on SAFETY beyond manufacturing facilities and operation sites. Cons:Headquarter location (Decatur, IL) is not ideal for new colleagues to settle long term. The new corporate location (Chicago, IL) is only limited to upper management at the moment. Other locations are situated in smaller communities throughout the Midwest due to the commodity driven market (supply and demand logistics). Advice to Management:It is important to Recognize, Respect, and Retain employees with talents to encourage continuous improvement among different business functions.

Good Place To Start Your Grain Trading Career,Merchandiser,"Pros:- Very hands on work, learn as you go - Access to market movers. ""Why did soybeans go up 10 today or why did the spread firm 3?"" Answer: ""Because we did X and Y"". - Plenty of experienced people to help answer questions and lead the way - Plenty of opportunities to move around the country and world, see new places, meet new people -Benefits such has health and 401k matching are great, probably some of the best around - ADM is very respected in the agribusiness world, always gets good remarks from the competition and customers -Moving packages are generous, covers the cost of moving and then some -Starting salary as a merchandiser can be bleh, but if you do well, several raises will come your way over the next couple of years. Cons:Really, only cons are salary, hours, and technology. Salary is OK, one can definitely be comfortable with what is earned, but still lags behind the industry standard. You could argue though that this lower salary is traded for job security. Other firms if you don't do well, you get canned. Here, you would stay on and get several chances before being fired. The other con is hours, and I mean the sense that if it's dead in the office, you're still expected to stick around. With technology today, much of your job can be done outside of the office. However, it seems there's still the attitude that if you're not in the office, you're not working. Finally, technology. The systems we use to track contracts, contacts, A/R, everything is decades old. And I mean decades. Information is not easy to access. Even the simplest things like looking up a contract balance can be a daunting task if you don't have the right permissions or know what commands to type. However, this is a known problem in the company, and millions of dollars are being spent to get us updated. By the time this gets rolled out though, the tech will likely be outdated. I won't hold my breathe. Advice to Management:Nothing to really add here. It would be nice if Pat would show her face every once in awhile. (I've never seen her on the trading floor. In fact, I don't think I've ever seen her in the Decatur office.) However, it's understood that ADM is heading more towards a value-added business, and not just grain handlers, so would make sense to spend time with that unit.",4,2014-10-20T00:00:00.000Z,5211587
Hopeful for change but not seeing it,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Decent pay. All the hours you can handle. There are some really good people working here. Definitely not going to be let go. Cons:Nobody gets fired for any reason as long as they show up. This makes the work harder for the ones that try to pick up the slack for the ones just collecting a pay check (hourly and salary). The good employees get fed up and leave. Meanwhile management won't trim the fat because nobody else wants the job, and they won't find anyone until the facility gets rid of the poor workers and replaces them. It's a vicious cycle that is quickly turning into a tight spiral downward. Hopefully when this place inevitably crash lands, someone will be able to pick up the pieces and make something decent out of them. Advice to Management:Pay a little more attention to the individual plants, and not just when the key performance indicators tell you to.",2,2014-09-25T00:00:00.000Z,5038800
"Good pay, terrible management. Money isn't everything, unless you're ADM, of course.","Anonymous in Hazle Township, PA","Pros:Better than average pay. Even entry level laborers earn a respectable wage. Good group of coworkers and floor level supervisors. Not always necessary to ""run your butt off"" to keep up with workload. Good 401k investment options. Cons:Upper level management has literally no regard or respect for the workers, and is shameless in demonstrating their disdain. Sounds extreme, but it truly borders on sociopathic. Workers cafeteria has elementary school style and size lunch tables. When complaints were lodged, response from plant superintendent was that they didn't want you in there for long, so they're not going to make it comfortable. Management cafe is another story, however. Reward for hitting a safety goal in most places may be a sweatshirt or coffee mug... we once got a candy cane and a packet of hot cocoa mix, because it was near the holidays. Employee drops unconscious in the entry hallway, is forced to leave via ambulance...and then is charged a day on his attendance record for leaving. Working environment is 120°F or more in much of the plant. Work schedule is impossible to live your life around. Full production scheduled on major holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas, all while equipment sat idle for weeks prior. And unless you have an engineering degree (brains optional), don't even bother suggesting an improvement to the process. If it ever gets implemented at all, it will only be months or years after your suggestion, and after an engineer has reintroduced the idea as his own and taken credit for it. Advice to Management:If you're going to drink Kool-Aid, try to sip rather than chug. Also, no need to use a crazy straw.",2,2014-09-11T00:00:00.000Z,4948051
R&D summer intern,Anonymous Employee,Pros:-Boss was cool -Learned and implemented valuable techniques involving common chemical engineering software -Got to visit production facilities and interact with project leaders and engineers on site.

Great place to gain experience but very controlling management,Anonymous Employee,Pros:There are a lot of opportunities to get involved in interesting projects. The pay is good but not outstanding. There are a lot of folks with experience that are willing to help you develop yourself. Cons:Management is fearful and often values membership in the old boys club more than results. They hold a lot of good people back because they are afraid of giving up control of ideas or the process. They will actively interfere with implementing ideas that are cost effective because they are afraid it might make them look bad. Advice to Management:Results need to count for something. You need to eliminate managers that do not do anything more than pick on people with minor issues that deliver results. It is almost too late to undo the damage that has been done as there are very few experienced engineers left. Managers need to bring something to the table other than intimidation. I have been kept out of conference calls with management on large capital projects that I designed. How the hell does that make anyone feel like sticking around?,2,2014-10-27T00:00:00.000Z,5253079

Some evaluation methods were poor indicators of performance. Underperforming individuals were not held accountable for their lack of productivity, lack of skills, and lack of desire to better their skills. I saw one full time employee spend 25+ hours online shopping, taking long lunches while I was waiting for reviews on my work. Relocating to Decatur is also an unfortunate requirement. Some people in the department were known for how inappropriate they were. Early on in my intern ship I was exposed to wildly inappropriate conversations that made me felt uncomfortable.

There is such a disconnect between management and hourly employees to a level that creates a very unsafe working environment. Most safety issues that are brought to management's attention are dis-regarded until a serious incident happens that can't be ""pushed under the rug"" and after the employee is blamed for the incident, then the proper engineering changes are made. We are forced to work all major holidays without so much as a thank you, while management gets to celebrate those holidays with their families. If you are seriously considering a career at adm cocoa hazleton you might also want to brush up on your firefighting skills, we are not allowed to call 911 in the event of a fire because upper level management doesn't want deal with the publicity, so we are handed water squirting bottles and off to the fight!

Your ROIC will skyrocket. Create local challenges for each plant; similiar to the billion dollar challenge - you'll be suprised at the feedback you'll recieve from first hand plant workers.

Great employer that encourages all employees to gain new career opportunities within the company.,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Many advancement opportunities. Upper management willing to listen to what you want out of the job and your goals for the future. There are a lot of different ingredient plants across the country so if you decide you don't like a certain ingredient theres plenty to choose from.

Soul killing but you'll be kept physically safe.,"Lab Technician in Decatur, IL","Pros:Wonderful co-workers. Safety is the top priority and every effort is made to ensure the safety of their employees - even if it makes a job more difficult. ADM does provide any necessary PPE and will try to get you the tools you need to complete a job safely. They do offer some good benefits packages and the position is a great way to gain experience so you can move on to a non soul-hurting job. Cons:Constant overtime, working around 50 hours a week is a slow week. Many of the policies are senseless and there is a good chance of having something held against you as a reason to not be given a raise, which is something that comes up only once a year. The lab is on a rotating swing shift that should give you 40 hours a week and once a month, a four day weekend. However due to staffing issues and a high turnover there is an endless amount of overtime and having 4-7 12 hour days is normal. The work is easy, but due to a the amount of work you are expected to complete it can be stressful if you are the type of person who wants to finish all their assigned work. Many of the employees complain, when they first start with the company. After working there for a while employees become complacent and stop complaining to management as no changes are actually implemented. Management does claim they will try to improve conditions but have been saying that for years. Advice to Management:Talk to your employees and implement some suggestions. Try to hire some more employees to reduce the workload. Encourage your employees by offering some incentives for being leaders in the lab.",2,2014-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,4166129

Complete lack of development/advancement opportunites for professional employees, especially women and minorities. Benefits such as retirement, medical retirement, vacation and PIP slashed for employees with less than 10 years of service. Advice to Management:Invest and develop in your technical personnel.

The company is stuck in the 1970s,"Accounting Supervisor in Decatur, IL",Pros:Good place for Agribusiness experience. Largest publicly traded player in the industry. Well Respected organization.

Schizophrenic HR resource planning,Senior Auditor in Rolle,"Pros:- good work-life balance - quite basic and simple tasks (you do not have to be a genius) - excellent experience with plenty of training for learning financial audit - Rolle, Switzerland, is located in a lovely place and you can do jogging during lunch time - good performance appraisal - good environment in Switzerland (until will last) Cons:- The main issue is that HR Resource Planning is unpredictable, to say the least. It's hard to plan your life (e.g. family, kids) with a company that does not tell you clearly if they have plans to relocate (in cheaper countries) in the next 2 years. They relocated and hired hundreds of people in Switzerland between 2008 and 2010 and since 2012 they have started making redundancies. - routinary activities with hundreds of spreadsheets can become boring after a while - do not trust when they say that you are a talent and they want to retain you. It's just a slogan - If you dont have a US passport it's hard to climb the ladder Advice to Management:Keep in consideration all the factors when planning. Do not treat non-US people like parcels to move from one country to another or just to replace with new, cheaper ones.",2,2014-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,3599223
Good company to work for,"Electrical Supervisor in Galveston, TX","Pros:Seems to be a good company to work for. Good Benefits, good principles. Very safety ethically oriented as a company.

Cons:If you like working 70 - 80 hours a week under incredible stress, this is the place for you. I worked 23 years under these conditions under my heart blew.

"A decade of excellent service means nothing compared to ""shareholder value"".","Corporate Accounting in Decatur, IL","Pros:Above average health and retirement benefits Cons:Lower than average salaries for entry-level management or office ""grunts"". Upper tier of management shows concern over waste, yet will leap into some high-risk ventures while dragging feet on making desirable or necessary upgrades to processes or equipment. Advice to Management:Profits are important, as well as people. Saving dollars by cutting back on overseas investments would seem a more desirable method than via company-wide layoffs. Also, don't panic if profits for a year drop and then bring out the chopping block. Heavily investing in the wrong markets helped bring about loses, not the laid-off persons from corporate headquarters and elsewhere. Then continue to handout double digit dividends to shareholders...?",3,2013-04-11T00:00:00.000Z,2551436
"Fun summer, but Corporate process not for me.","Commodities Merchandising in West, TX","Pros:They paid for relocation, and also for summer apartment at location. Most people who trade at the branch offices are younger guys who were just out of college--this made socializing in the summer a lot of fun. Apartment had pool and was on college campus so met a lot of cool people (apartment choice is entirely dependent on branch manager.) High percentage of interns are hired on as long as you really impress your branch manager. They have a final interview process in head quarters if you want to work full time. Hourly summer rate allows for potential overtime. Able to execute MASSIVE trades. Sent far from home so was able to experience and travel to a lot of different places in the South West (I'm from Chicago). Loved the people I worked with and will be friend with one of the merchandisers for many years to come. Able to pick final date as long as it was during the 11th week. Cons:ADM is massive, and you will have no say in where your placement will be. I was 20 hours from home so I was incredibly home sick and started counting down until I left the moment I got there. My manager didn't allow me to get as much overtime as I could have. You need to take your own vehicle to location, so this will add a lot of miles. IF hired full-time a Merchandiser has SOME say in the region they would like to work, but I know people who were placed 30 hours from home, 8, 12, or 3. Not many close though. (*I was highly recommended for full-time employment but took better offer from company closer to home.) IF you don't have many strong ties to home and love to get a change of scenery every 2-3 years than this is an AWESOME company. They have great benefits, and you meet interesting people. I just needed to be back in a metropolis. I was glad I did this because it really reassured that. Advice to Management:Interns know how mundane and unimportant they are, but ask if they have a regional preference. I know it can't be minutes from home but a few hour drive is better than 20+ hours. Or possibly provide interns who work over 10 hours from home with a plane ticket voucher to fly home sometime in July.",3,2013-04-01T00:00:00.000Z,2521304

If you're considering a position in the QC Lab, you'd be better off pumping septic systems with a drinking straw than tolerating the broomstick riding manager. Cons:People not qualified being put in supervisory positions. Those people then treat you like trash and lie to cover their own behinds. Obviously fat and lazy is rewarded and if you don't kiss fat and lazy's ass, you're not ""ADM Material"". Advice to Management:Cut the FAT!!! I mean that figuratively and literally. SHE is the reason you can't keep the lab fully staffed. I think we've been through five employees in the last six months and everyone leaves because she runs them off. We're tired of working so much overtime and missing our families because her mouth is inappropriate and offensive to new hires.",2,2013-01-19T00:00:00.000Z,2295318

Company very disrespectful of its employees-do not go to work there!!!,"Accountant in Decatur, IL","Pros:work/family life ok. Benefits are so/so. I am however now on husbands CAT insurance and it is far better Cons:If it is 1st 2 weeks of the month expect to work very late nights and will never be able to have any time off during that period. Management thinks it is above everyone. laid off very good employees and left ones that play on the internet all day. Also left ones that get by with doing as little as possible. One guy that got laid off was the first one to get there and the last one to leave every night. Have the stupid goals that have to be revised every year. Your promotions and pay raises are based on these goals. Last year even after the lousy 3% raise was given I was told to make changes to my goals. Now how can that be a goal?????? Treat their clerks or anyone without a degree like they are peons. Advice to Management:Treat you employees with some respect. You claim to be a team so act like it. Don't lay off good hard workers and if you do have to lay people off, it shouldn't be left up to the employees upper supervior to make that kind of decision. If they don't care for a person that is the ones that got the ax. It should have been done by Seniority. The way you handled things it was not a lay off it was the firing of people.",1,2012-05-02T00:00:00.000Z,1484793
Mundane,Commodity Merchandising Intern,"Pros:I don't have anything against the company. It is just a fairly basic job that got old very quickly.

They are down to earth and have that southern hospitality -They seemed to be lenient on taking days off -Good work hours Cons:-Very Mundane. I had done basically everything task I would ever do on the job within the first couple weeks. -Work not challenging -If you work there full time you will be required to relocate a lot over your first two years Advice to Management:-Give your interns more work to do.

Great Place to get experience,"Lab Technician in Clinton, IA",Pros:The people are great and it was a good place to get laboratory experience right out of college. Able to stay busy and the time will go by fast. Great benefits and pay Cons:Rotating shifts. Twelve hour shifts rotating between day shift and night shift.

Focus on maximizing employee potential and recognizing and rewarding excellence and your entire paradigm will shift causing an abundance in market-share growth and customer loyalty.

"Very poor management, decent pay, brutal hours","Director of Tax in Decatur, IL","Pros:Decent pay and benefits, co-workers and staff people generally easy to work with Cons:Terrible review process, most management is unqualified, expectations unrealistic, 70 -80 hour workweeks. I worked under a manager for 20 years that rarely worked a full week and treated employees terribly, yet he kept his job, you could never talk to him without condescending arrogant replies. When he retired, he was replaced by a person who only knew anything about federal and international tax, and was a horrible manager; you could never trust what he said as he would reverse it a week later; put extreme stress and pressure on the dept. Company wide, morale is very poor. I finally had enough and retired early because of heart problems which I place the blame for directly on ADM, in short, I was being worked to death. There is also a lot of corruption. Advice to Management:Pat Woertz isn't qualified for this company as she came from an oil company which as is common opposes ethanol which ADM is the world's largest producer. Most of the old upper management knew this diverse company backwards and forward and most have quit.",2,2013-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,2294207
Unstable company,Operations Manager,"Pros:There were many wonderful, hard working folks I met while working at ADM. By now, most have moved on to better opportunities at other companies or have been affected by the RIF in February 2012. ADM was known for its dedication to employees, but as the Andreas family has moved on, the dedication to employees has disappeared. In the past, professionals would start and retire their careers at ADM due to the stability and family-like environment; therefore, employees were proud to work at ADM. I hope for the greater good and sake of the company that the stability and commitment to hard working employees will return soon. With good internal connections, there is ability to move cross-departmentally and change careers. Cons:Unfair compensation (especially for women), poor work-life balance, long hours for exempt employees, no development plans for the majority (a select few are chosen for management development programs but there is no set plan and much uncertainty so trainees leave before or shortly after completing the program), no promotion track, subjective ratings/reviews (even if a professional completes all goals and has gone above expectations, the employee is rated as ""meets"" at the most), very low culture or diversity, located in the middle of nowhere, high turnover, corrupt acts created mandatory trainings and tests for all employees - which takes much time out of one's work day, too many initiatives that are not related to the job are enforced (much of the working day is spent on initiatives and after hours may be spent on catching up on the day work), unbalance of workload (there are many folks who cruise and waste time while other hard working professionals pick up the slack, especially middle management - who are known as ""working managers"" – has to do their direct report's work and their own work), reported harassment and discrimination cases may be reviewed but are rarely in the favor of the plaintiff and result in an unjust conclusion (many times the employee that was harassed or discriminated against was later demoted, asked to seek external opportunities, or nothing was done to resolve the issue), sr. management continues to shift from their ever changing plans, very unstable with no clear direction or focus, always cost cutting and then spending money where there are no returns, the service groups are treated poorly compared to commercial or profit centers, stock price continues to slip even with sr. management's initiatives (RIF, cost cutting contests, etc...), and downsizing continues to happen today.

Appears to be the same within the accounting department. Sales and lab personnel seem satisfied. Advice to Management:Training courses for employees in positions of training.

Salaries are below the industry average and raises are based on a faulty review system. Cons:Although the organization is a Fortune 28 company, they have a number of internal struggles. Including promoting leaders who do not possess leadership skills. Often, promotions are based on who is wearing your T-shirt, who you know and who is in the private meeting to speak on your behalf. The company is good at what they do but suffer from being a bit arrogant in their relationships. There is a lack of commitment to diversity and inclusion. Leaders are not committed to true development of the general population of employees. They prefer to hand pick those whom they believe deserve to be developed.

Traumatic,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:If you are a favorite among management...I suppose it would be a wonderful place to work. If you have family in upper management, you can get almost any job you please. Cons:There is absolutely no respect among managment/co-workers and no line that cannot be crossed. There's no growth/advancement; managers will either be honest and tell you that or blow smoke up your butt. The managament at this facility in PA clearly know they can undercut people in pay because of location/economy. They have started hiring people off the street because all the good workers leave. Whether you work hard or do nothing you get the same ""raise"",no one gets told when they're doing a good or bad job. As far as leadership is concerned...the managers are arrogant engineers, they don't know how to lead or manage. Overall, I hope I never experience a place like this ever again, I wouldn't wish employment at ADM on my worst enemy.

"ADM, a great place to build a career","Accountant in Decatur, IL","Pros:The benefits package as well as the flexibility. I feel it is very important that a company be able to work with you on personal issues as needed. Teleworking is also a great benefit! Archer Daniels Midland also opens up doors for opportunities outside of the normal day to day activities. They bring in outside speakers for events and take care of their employees. For the last two years every employee of the company has received a bonus following the fiscal year report. Pat Woertz and the board of directors know that ADM would not be where it is today without the colleagues that work for the company. This sort of appreciation shows that ADM understands that there is more that just money to be made but also building relationships. Cons:From time to time communication can be an issue. Some departments or locations may hear news before others or the rest may never hear the news. Pat has done a great job trying to turn this around. She gets out in front of her colleagues as much as possible and sends out regular communications via the email system. Pat also made a great effort to visit outside locations and to get to know those who work for ADM. Even with these great strides, more needs to be done. Information needs to flow freely through the company. There is not one place that you can find all announcements. They are spread out on the intranet or on bulletin boards.

High formative experience,Senior Internal Auditor in Cergy,"Pros:3M offers the opportunity for people to take responsibilities in a very dynamic organization. They give the chance to take initiatives whatever the position. Wide variety of businesses and processes Strong organization Cons:The managers are changing very often of positions and as the culture is to consider that changes are providing always added value, I had several managers with very low experience in their position. and therefore their capacity to bring technical support to their subordinates is rather poor. The way you are perceived in your job can change very quickly from positive to negative in particular if you don't show strong motivation to move to another position after 3-4 years. The worst can be as in my case to be considered as not anymore valuable because of too much time spent in the position. The acknowledge of my technical competencies by my managers was rather low while in the same time the job was obviously very correctly done. Here the question of the matching between the culture of the company and myself was the reason raised to justify that from their side !

tough times and going downhill fast,"Research & Development in Maplewood, MN","Pros:flexible scheduling good parental leave (if you decide to have kids) sick days/short term disability policy Cons:Employee morale is terrible currently and I don't see it improving any time soon. Every year perks and benefits get taken away from us. There is a lack of transparent communication and vision from execs/management/supervisors. Lack of accountability for underperforming employees or supervisors who bully, they just get ""coached"" to do better. Need 7 layers of approval to do ANYTHING! We are currently not even allowed to spend $1 without getting a VP approval! The company says they pay for performance but there are only so many ""exceeds expectations"" they are allowed to give out on annual reviews, so even if a person is over performing they will get the same performance review rating as someone who comes to work and does the bare minimum of their job. No clear path for promotions and everything is dependant on how your supervisor feels about you personally and not how you actually perform your job. Advice to Management:be transparent and communicate. work on company culture and improving morale! Instead of all of these lay offs, perhaps 3M execs should take some responsibility for their actions for lack of success and take a pay cut to cut costs - just like the CEO of zoom. Stop with the private jets and first class - execs should have to fly coach just like the rest of us peons are made to do. cut out middle management bloat instead of laying off the employees that are ""in the trenches"". Go back to Mcknight principles and hire good people and leave them alone, instead of micromanaging everything that employees do. bring back the 1-5 grading system for employee reviews so that it is actually possible to get a better than ""does your job"" - OR how about not putting quotas on how many exceeds expectations you are allowed to give out and actually give them out when deserved and not just when someone is looking to get a promotion. I hope that with spinco/parentco that we will re-imagine and refocus what 3M is and will be for the better, but I doubt it with the way everything is getting communicated (or lack there-of).",1,2023-02-23T00:00:00.000Z,73912243

Medical Sales Reps - Dead End Road,Sales Representative,"Pros:Work Life Balance Easy Job This review is for the medical side of the business. As with anything, the other vertices may differ drastically Cons:Moral is horrible. Turnover is high. Marketing company not focused on sales. Changes in direction every year. Lackluster leadership - can’t motivate or inspire. Motivate through fear. Laid off every employee with an exemption. Sexist, boys club. Unprofessional environment. Militaristic pay structure lags behind industry. They hire young interns to replace seasoned reps. Promote through boys club - you will know more than your boss. Reps lack integrity and morals. The company does not focus on the patient. There is no development or professional growth promotions not based on knowledge or work ethic. Be prepared to wear many hats and take on the jobs of others. Customer service was a 10 out of 10 now it is around 1-2 out of 10. The on going “training” is awful - 0 value ad 100% time wasted. The 401k is awful. I could think of more but I’m sure you’ve got the picture by now. If you’re an actual med device rep with determination and drive, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

Avoid R&amp;D roles unless it's in a factory,"Product Development Engineer in Bracknell, England","Pros:Good pension benefit and employee stock purchase plan. Good team-mates, I have made life-long friendships from this role. Really cutting edge work being done in factories. Easy job for sales - just sell the quality products the parent organisation in the US delivers. Cons:I spent over 4 years working at 3M. I was hired as a software graduate but the company didn't seem to know how to turn a graduate into a software programmer. I had major impostor syndrome and I was afraid I wouldn't be able to find a job anywhere else. I found my time there to be a truly spirit crushing experience. I worked on a variety of projects, many experimental. I had the experience of attending meetings with people who knew a project was due to be scrapped and would lie to you about it (to this day, I still don't understand why). Consequence was that I would continue to work on something pointless instead of re-directing my time elsewhere. Various cost-cutting measures introduced with false economies. I found that I suddenly had to do random administrative tasks that had previously been handled by a corporate team. My requests for help from that team were rebuffed (no performance appraisal benefit in them helping me). General technical incompetence. I witnessed a middle manager overseeing a team of well paid engineers ask why the data in a relational database couldn't all be stored in one table. Corporate IT asked me to share my password with them in order to fix something on my computer. An ideal environment for corporate psychopaths and self promoters. In my first week I attended a presentation by senior employees about career management. The advice was ""manage your manager"". This turned out to be true. People who spent time promoting themselves to their managers seemed to do a lot better than those who just kept their heads down, worked hard and delivered results. I saw a beautiful house of cards get built, the builder promote someone else into looking after it before taking the credit and moving on, leaving a live hand grenade behind. Parent company in the US seemed to keep appointing a new MD. Depending on what the current numbers were like the corporate strategy alternated between ""get rid of people to get costs down"" and ""boost R&amp;D spending to increase the share of revenue coming from new products"". After a round of redundancies where mid-level technical staff were let go because ""R&amp;D efforts weren't in line with corporate strategy"" but none of the technical leaders were let go, despite ""wasting"" resource on the very same thing, I decided to deal with my anxiety and just leave. Advice to Management:This is a tricky one - the real corporate masters are in the US. The injustices I saw in the work appraisal process were the biggest problem for me. I would challenge management right across the organisation to actually observe what their reports are doing and try to measure value objectively. Ask the people they work with, not them.",1,2023-01-18T00:00:00.000Z,72736763

Career Setback - Island of the Lotus Eaters,"Information Technology in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:To be honest, the employee benefits are the best I have seen in all my various careers. 3M offers an employee store where you can purchase 3M products at production cost. Excellent salary. 3M really stepped up during COVID by sending all employees a COVID care package which included cloth masks (10), anti-bacterial sanitizer, and a zero-touch door opening tool. Zero on-call responsibility. The offerings for people that were affected by the (still ongoing) reduction in force (RIF) were better than I have seen elsewhere. Everything from coaching, expert consultants, access to job fairs, etc. It was by far the most well executed and organized RIF - maybe this is a negative? Cons:I have never seen a company spend so much time, effort, and money on all the stuff they physically mail. All of the content was simply, “look how awesome everything is at 3M; you are valued” and had zero value other than to the people who were picked to pose in the articles. God help you if you want to make positive change. It is like the mob - they will whack you, your family, and your pets. You are good if you are okay with the “this is the way we’ve always done it” mentality. By far the most political environment in which I have ever worked. Everything is a favor and not “just do your job”. 3M is way too big for an individual contributor to matter. Everyone starts out shiny, hopeful, and wanting to help out your fellow 3M’rs but after a few months that all changes to frustration, anger, and despair. You are, quite literally, an employee number, an expense, and a line item on a spreadsheet. If you think you matter, I promise you that you do not. If you think you are part of a larger purpose or mission, I promise you that you are not. If you think your contributions have made a difference, I promise you that someone else took the credit for it instead of you (but you will never know). Management would let people go and you wouldn’t find out until you attempted to reach out to them and never got a response. When you finally get fed up with the lack of response and reach out to their manager, you are finally told that they are no longer with the company. When asked who their replacement is for XYZ function you are told that there is no one and there will be no backfill because there is a constant hiring freeze. Huh? I had absolutely zero 3M-funded training during employment. Whenever management was asked about funds for XYZ training, employees were given the runaround and eventually would stop asking altogether. For the first time in my IT career, I paid for my own training, event fees, and certification costs. This is a standard benefit afforded to almost any IT professional by a company (unless you work at 3M). I saved this for last. If you feel that this is inaccurate, please read some news articles before considering employment. Google “13-million-3m-earplug-verdict” to get a nicely summarized summary. Shady business practices and tactics. 3M touted itself as a company “based on ethics” - I am sure that ethics exist somewhere at 3M but I don’t consider screwing veterans and other responders out of settlement money by splitting a company into two, where one is profitable (new healthcare company) and the other not so profitable (PostIt notes, Meguiars, Nexcare, and everything else) with the intent to bankrupt the legacy 3M hoping to subvert paying what is rightfully owed. Additionally, I don’t think it was very ethical to invoke a huge reduction in force (which is still on-going) just a day or two after the judge called BS on that plan. After the reduction in force was enacted, and then applying for jobs, I quickly realized that my time at 3M had actually crippled my career because everything was so massively siloed that you didn’t have the ability to grow much less get anything done effectively or in a timely manner; but you stayed because the pay is awesome and benefits were great. You lose a bit of your soul in exchange for benefits, pay, and flexibility; believe me, it isn’t worth it to put the 3M name on your resume. The severance pay was definitely not commensurate with the tenure, effort, contributions, blood, sweat, and tears spent. I am sure this review will be buried by an over-abundance of false “everything is great” and “Mike Roman cares and his employees love him” type propaganda but I hope it helps just one potential candidate. 3M sickens me and I am ashamed that I was proud to work there. In fact, I purposely do not buy their products even if I perceive their product as better. Advice to Management:Not enough time in a day to write anything here because it would have zero impact for change. Perhaps the shareholders will listen to their employees' feedback after they are forced to pay out. Nothing makes people pay attention and listen more than when you mess with their investment portfolio.",3,2023-01-08T00:00:00.000Z,72432140

Too much deadweight,Anonymous Employee in Singapore,"Pros:Depends on which team you are in. Flexible working hours with proper balance if you can manage it well. They are indeed trying to transform and improve the workplace but results are slow and low. Cons:- Below average benefits compared to other same size US companies. Better don't fall sick when working here. Non existent dependent insurance - everything needs to be paid to have a small amount of coverage. - Annual increment % one of the lowest I have ever seen for SG mnc. HR not fully honest when recruiting. Bonus % by rank is also low. - Too many old people who have worked for 15-30 years at the company at really high rank but with super old mindset. - Managers that does not know anything but have a very high rank due to tenure at the company. - Too many people who does not do what they are supposed to do, and somehow let off the hook whenever mistakes happen. Escalations are not taken seriously. - No team building/meal budget or any remote working compensation. - Office location super inconvenient if you need to go in to office. - No transparency in reward/job promotion. Not like other companies, you will not know what job grade/rank others are at because job title seems to be completely misleading and random for some jobs. This is probably to cover up the fact that a lot of long tenured folks are already at very high rank and not doing what they are supposed to do at that level. This is something that really needs to be looked into by HR I believe. You cannot improve your employees if there is no transparency as to how to move to the next level or progress. Good people will always leave while people who are looking to retire will stay and be stagnant. - Their motto is hire to retire - which explains my point above. I have never seen so many lazy people in one company, and they are all here. - Everything takes really slow to implement. Deadlines are never taken seriously and constantly postponed. Advice to Management:Leaders should talk to HR and think about how to retain employees who are actually working. Focus on improving your benefits to attract talent. And also reward people who work hard, not those that have been 3M for decades.",3,2023-01-07T00:00:00.000Z,72400999

People generally are more collaborative than competitive. Theoretically you can grow to high levels (and pay) without having to be a manager of people. A stronger than average culture of listening to ideas and empowering people to do improvements themselves. Cons:A lot of radical changes are taking place too fast. In general most of the changes make sense in strategical terms, but there is the feeling the company is rushing to get them done, and then new changes come that conflict with changes that haven't finalized. There have been restructuring measures essentially once a year over the last 5 years, all of them obeying to distinct strategies and situations and impacting different areas of the company, but overall sentiment from people I know is that there is no longer any sense that your job is secure. Many of these changes are announced with so little detail that people can't even start to understand them; this feels like lack of transparency and that leaders would rather not let employees know what is happening to have them under their control.

Current culture issues,IT Manager,"Pros:Working with talented people across the globe Cons:Management's ability to lead and provide a safe, inclusive environment. Company markets this in their Diversity and Inclusion policies, but never seems to audit whether they are actually compliant with it. Especially if there are problems with upline executives. While they provide the advice to talk to HR, even if you formalize that, HR will never respond with actions taken or even follow up with you to see if the environment is better. HR has the EthicsPoint process, but even that is a dead-end for employees that look for help to have a respectful workplace. They just seem to want the problem to go away hoping that if they don't respond to an employee, the employee will just deal with it. That is NOT inclusive behavior! Advice to Management:Lead by example, hold leadership accountable for actions and behaviors. Put leadership in place that knows how to lead, are not purely individual contributors that happen to know the right people to get promoted.

Worst Mistake of My Life,Sales Manager in Singapore,"Pros:- Very flexible working arrangements not only during the peak of the COVID pandemic but also following this on a permanent basis. Cons:*Not offered an exit interview so 3M Singapore, consider this my feedback* - Leadership is extremely disconnected from the face of the business and is clueless as to how the industry operates. - Continual restructuring to the point that many people do not know what their actual job function is. - Globally led marketing strategies with little to no empowerment of staff at a Regional or Country level in being able to customise to their needs. - Many ill qualified people in senior positions that appear to have been rewarded for length of service as opposed to being the right person for the job. Same people being pushed around into different positions on a regular basis. - Continual fear of loosing your job through thousands of job cuts over 2 - 3 years. - Terrible recruitment strategies and non-existent retention strategies. - Zero team building or company organised social activities. Not even remote events during COVID. - Zero ongoing professional development. - Despite being told of great career opportunities, these do not exist. - Terrible work culture and expectation to work grossly extended hours and over weekends and public holidays with no appetite from management to fix this. - Culture elements such as 'customer at the core' are simply ignored in day to day business. - Over complicated and bureaucratic processes which prevent the company from being responsive to customer and industry needs. - Many staff who simply will not do their assigned job functions and Managers that do nothing to resolve this. - Focus is on share price and nothing else. - Innovation is dead. The company now just acquires technology and companies to broaden its portfolios. - Employee time is wasted on unnecessary administrative tasks that appease leadership and hinder people's ability to sell. - Zero performance feedback and prolonged periods of zero interaction with Manager. - Sales staff feel like they are disposable assets. - Management that values sales performance and personal friendships ahead of objective investigation and management of individuals who bully other employees and perpetuate a toxic work culture. - Many other reasons why working for this company was the worst mistake of my life. Advice to Management:After 3 years of restructuring there has been no discernible improvement in your profitability. Across the world, employees say the same things behind closed doors about working at 3M, too afraid to voice it to leaders: ""3M used to be the best company in the world to work for, it is now a sinking ship and the talent is jumping off as quick as they can."" You talk the talk and say things like speaking up and voicing opinion will not be punished and yet so many employees are unhappy and unwilling to speak up. Ask yourselves why this is. If you want to attract and retain good people, you need to change many leaders, stop shifting the same 10+ years leaders around and secure new ones, be competitive in your recruitment, have retention plans, structure the company in a much more simplified and efficient way and most importantly terminate the people perpetuating a toxic work culture.",1,2022-09-21T00:00:00.000Z,69278045

Even though we’re highly educated professionals, it truly doesn’t matter. Wasted talent as senior management makes all of the decisions-even though they have no idea what’s actually going on in the business. 3M has cultivated stagnant personnel as accountability and meeting deadlines does not exist. Many just show up to collect their pension. Moving up in the company depends on how many people you know, and if they like you. Making friends means more than being competent in your role.

Struggling with Challenges,IT Business Relationship Manager,"Pros:3M has a history as a great place to work. The past culture of the company has been such that you can go into a 3M office anywhere in the world and feel at home. This culture is morphing and, paired with a number of business challenges, makes 3M not such a fun place to be in 2022 / 2023. The company is trying hard to fight the litigation it faces and to spin off its Health Care business. If it can succeed on both of these fronts, I'm sure there will be brighter days ahead. Cons:The company is turbulent at this time (2022). There is a very heavy focus on the short term that has become so extreme, teams cannot even complete the last short term decisions before direction is shifted again. I started in the early 2000's and at that time, I spent about 60% of my time as a strategic thinker (fresh out of undergrad). As time went on, this became less and less of a focus, even as I grew in my career. Trying to wrestle leaders into strategic planning was generally met with deaf ears. Now, there is zero oxygen for long-term planning, at least within my function.",2,2022-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,68696608
Dim Future,Sales Manager,"Pros:3M is a large company that I had high hopes for when they purchased KCI. However, this merge has been a disaster. The only pro’s to the company is that they offer a company car and I enjoy working with my colleagues. Cons:3M has no idea how the wound vac business works. They just implement things they’ve seen at other companies and hope for the best. So much of the business is based on strong customer relationships. They let go of so many experienced representatives who have been in this business for over 10 years. They have ruined a reputable company and never took the time to understand how and why KCI was successful. I feel sorry for the people who are still there and hope they get out before further layoffs take place. Advice to Management:It’s much too late for advice. The hole has already been dug and at this point I have little faith this company will succeed. I hope it does for the sake of the employees still there. Customers have complained about the changes since 3M’s acquisition and how no one seems to know what they are doing. The only thing keeping customers from going to a competitor was their reps. We were constantly putting out fires. With you cutting your sales force, expanding territories and adding all of these additional responsibilities to them, business will be lost. It’s sad to see.",1,2022-09-04T00:00:00.000Z,68691586

Advice to Management:Push continuous improvement more as a concept and less as a deliverable. It seems most engineers have difficulty seeing projects to completion unless they're for Green Belt certification, and then it seems that LSS engagement drops dramatically.

Things are OK,Process Engineer,"Pros:1) 3M is a Fortune 500 Company and has a track record of success in manufacturing 2) 3M has numerous products and technology platforms 3) Employees have the ability to try different roles within a manufacturing site and within the company Cons:1) 3M has over 70 manufacturing sites in the US, and the vast majority of them are in rural locations. Most people would prefer to be in an urban/suburban area. In addition, the rural sites seem to get less attention and are neglected. 2)3M has went through restructuring around the time of the pandemic (2021) and has reduced headcount to a point where each role now has about 1.25 - 2 times the amount of work. In addition, there are so few people that there is not really an established on call system or back up system. 3) 3M Optimized Operations (rotational program) is a scam. This rotational program is advertised as an opportunity to work on projects and get experience at various 3M sites. In reality, this program is used as a tool to hire engineers for job req's that are not being filled (less desirable locations for instance). Advice to Management:1) Please hire more people to adequately staff manufacturing sites and stop paying attention to the finances 2) Please stop neglecting the 3M rural sites and give them the attention they need - invest in modernized office/production areas 3) 3M would be much more efficient if there were less manufacturing sites (10 or so) in the US. All of products in rural locations should be consolidated and moved to larger sites near urban areas (45 minute drive or less).",3,2022-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,63793041

Great co-wokers and supervisors,Customer Operations,"Pros:- People: You can find nice, kind and supportive people here. I worked with many departments and moved to worked under different teams within this 4 years, all of my supervisors are super supportive, motivating and always provided feedback for improvement. People here are very respectful and have good attitude at work. I can say that company is lucky to have greatest employees who make a good working environment. - opportunity: As it is Global company, you will have opportunities to work with people from many countries. My recent team members are from different 5 countries, I can learned a lot from them. This is a good experience. - Ethics and Compliance: This company have a solid policy about compliance (at least in my local office), I did not face any of issues in my office’s life. Cons:- Career path : It’ s hard to see your career path here especially in support function. My last role before resignation already transfer to GSC (Global Service Center), they did not hire new worker to replace me, that make me feel like if I still work here, I need to move to other functions over and over to find secure place that GSC cannot replacing me. - Globalization model : Not only work processing and policy but including organization structure. I was separated from local team and changed to under Asia team with just 1 week notice. I cannot help feel isolated and not enjoy working as a team like before. - System : Too many systems to work with just for one tasks, each systems are not sync and process owner is from different departments, so you need to work on many steps and contact many person to just completed 1 tasks. Everytimes, they tried to change process flow and make an excuse that to reduce local tasks, they just make the flow more complicated and local have more admin tasks to work. - Work load: If you think 3M is a big company, so it must have many people work for each scope, you might disappointed. It’s really hard to request more headcount. Work overtime is a required, even company try to value work life balance but the work can’t be done easily especially in this year which many countries are preparing to transform to SAP. - Reorganization, mental support : Company has rapidly changed. Some departments were terminated from reorganization and many employees were unhired to maintain company’s profit number statistics. Mental support should process by local team, mental issues is somehow globalized but actually it more sensitive and complex (most of them related with culture, situation of each country) and make sure to have psychology’s expert to support mental issues not just hire people who dont have psychology background to work for this area. Advice to Management:Make sure to listen to negative feedback and think carefully about the dimensions, I feel burn out because of irrational and messy changed. Some changing sound nice but did it really provided benefit to company? Another to add, my local HR is terrible, isn’t HR people need to have at least empathy and servicemind?",4,2022-05-01T00:00:00.000Z,63498773

not looking good,Outside Sales Representative,"Pros:great technical resources Company car can be used for personal use (never pay for gas again) Great flexibility Cons:This company has no idea how to use Salesforce. I have worked in multiple divisions, and each leader has their own idea of how to use it. what was once a stretch goal for activities and finding opportunities has now become the MINIMUM. The amount of info they want you to put in salesforce takes about 70% of your time. taking away from valuable sales time. this leads to an incredible amount of lying about actual activities and sales won-which will help you get promoted with no backfire. You may either have a HUGE territory or a only a couple counties. depends on which territory you get. If you have an entire state, be prepared to drive all the time, AND spend hours on Salesforce.com once you get home. Leadership continues to create more homework on Salesforce in order to micro manage but explains it in a way to hide the fact that they are micromanaging you. There is a terrible culture where leadership never wants to hear any bad news or criticism about management. they promote those that worship their feet, without any thought about experience or ability to do the job. 3M has increased its price to its customers 4 times within the past year while only giving a 2% raise to sales reps that hit quota last year. Many reps have left recently because they know they can get better pay and have some sense of self respect. Advice to Management:-lay off your sales reps, and allow them to work how they see fit. judge them at the end of the year not every month. -You can't understand what your reps do daily by forcing them to log every little thing in Salesforce. - Understand that many reps are leaving and many are unhappy, and a minimal pay increase is a huge slap in the face",3,2022-04-19T00:00:00.000Z,62982074

USAC killed it,"Sales in Toronto, ON","Pros:Base pay is really good and so is the RRSP plan. Variable pay sucks. Cons:3M was great. USAC is a new restructuring where the US eliminated resourcing for Canada and killed its high performing culture. As a result all the good talent left. Zero local upward mobility and stagnant wages. US has this astonishing combination of useless meetings and endless spinning of tires for approvals to do anything, but at the same time offering no support or real care for the Canadian business. Competitors in Canada are starting to eat 3M alive because of the lack of focus locally. It’s really too bad because before this restructure it was a different company. Sales professionals look elsewhere, there are better opportunities as there is zero incentive to outperform anymore. Advice to Management:Canadian managers were always supportive and fantastic, bright individuals. Unfortunately most of them left in the last 2 years for greener pastures. US management doesn’t have a clue what they are doing and it shows in the financials.",2,2022-04-13T00:00:00.000Z,62754047

Marketers - avoid at all costs,Marketing Executive,"Pros:Good company welfare and good culture. Peer Recognition system is good. Many training courses/sessions to attend. Strong engineering company. Cons:Poor leadership and poor execution. Current marketing setup doesn’t make sense as marketing team doesn’t have any say in campaigns at all. Budgets + strategy are determined by business and marketing leads are really project/campaign managers to ensure campaigns get launched. No opportunity for any inputs/value adds because that’s how the setup is intended to be. Marketing skills needed is minimal since the role is like a middle man of sorts. More importantly, leadership of marketing at regional level needs to be reviewed. Under the new org, new management doesn’t really care about marketing, seems like their lowest priority amidst other issues. Upper Leadership doesn’t care (or maybe doesn’t know/unaware of issues), middle level managers always have many reasons/excuses for why things are the way it is. Hence not much change going around, all talk but no action and this is very disappointing &amp; frustrating for marketers. No one is held accountable for poor campaign performance/execution in the org sadly. Inputs given from ground level usually falls on dead ears or not acted upon - shoes that management is doing things for the sake of doing but not genuine at all. Company is also very Process oriented and not agile to market. Will not recommend any marketers to join unless you would like to be a project manager. Advice to Management:Look at external hires more please. Company’s culture is so ridden with so many veterans that it makes 3M slow to market and less agile to customer needs. You need more external perspective. And please review middle management competence as there is minimal accountability. Current marketing system is not set up for success.",2,2022-04-09T00:00:00.000Z,62529688

Micromanagement is their thinking to be successful,Service Desk Analyst in Heredia,"Pros:Benefits: Transportation. WFH. Food subsidy. Learning Courses. Solidarity Association: ASO3M. Parking. Cons:Micromanagement is incredible. Bootlickers. Favoritism. No feedback when being rejected when applying internally. They will always prefer quantity over quality, even if you are doing an excellent job but not getting their numbers, it does not matter you will be a bad employee. When applying to a different position/role, your manager will influence to affect you if they want you to move or not (in case they need you on the department you are or, if they just does not want you to move). No patience when making mistakes, if you are making mistakes they will tell you what you are doing, but they will not help you improve that or teach you how and they have fired people because of that instead of being diverse and understanding we all are different. Depending on the department you are applying for, you will be force to work overtime hours because you have to, not if you want to. Because of the high volume they are always getting. A lot of departments are under staff because everyone is quitting or they just fired people they don't like. Diversity and inclusion at 3M Costa Rica is not real, if you are not how they want you to be, you will be a bad employee and they will do everything they can to get you fired. So, if you feel they are trying to do this, I would recommend you to start looking for other jobs because they will make your work environment the worst you could have. Analyze your supervisor and confirm if you could trust her/him because depending on the person, they will use your problems against you. Requesting vacations or free time becuase you need to do something personal is a pain. You always have to explain yourself and let them know ""how important"" is what you need to do, so they can give you the free time or your vacations. There is NO intrinsic motivation. This is not important for them. YOU should look for your own motivation. Advice to Management:Train your mid level managers so they can truly be leaders instead of bosses micromanaging their employees.",2,2022-03-19T00:00:00.000Z,61434025
"Productive and Respectful Work Environment, Weak Pay and Benefits","Production Support Engineer in Minneapolis, MN","Pros:I think the biggest boon for my division is the hiring practices -- everyone on the team is communicative and competent, but also respects your time and are not invasive. I have never had a manager interrogate me about why I was late to a shift or what kind of appointment I'm going to. As long as you accomplish your work, nobody will demand more than that of your time. Other employees are eager to encourage other team members to take time off or leave when it's their time to leave. Managers have been very flexible as I have chosen to change my daily schedule. Functionally unlimited PTO. This is an unspoken situation with the contractor. Low workload. My skillset is respected in my workplace but my work takes less than half a day to accomplish. I was kept on after covid hit -- I was hired just before the pandemic and would've have been the LIFO layoff, however 3M was conservative and our division was lucrative so layoffs were unnecessary. I am very grateful for job stability during this time. 3M has decided to be a ""flexible"" working environment. Specifically, employees can now choose to be entirely remote, hybrid, or exclusively in office. ""Flat"" management structure. Project level teams determine leadership naturally. Most employees are very independent. Little hierarchy between employees and management. 3M is a well respected employer and looks great on a resume. Cons:Contract work -- I am not technically employed by 3M and don't get 3M benefits. Almost half of my division functions this way. This is a sector wide problem, not exclusive to 3M at all. I haven't had a pay increase in 2.5 years. My pay is low to midrange for a starting wage in my position with my skillset, and has not increased. This position in my division functions as a junior software dev position, but I have been given no information about what I need to do to be promoted after half a dozen quarterly reviews, all of which described my work as immaculate. My daily work does little to advance my skillset towards this end. I have made independent efforts to take on extra work to prove that I'm ready to be promoted, but this has not been acknowledged as a meaningful move forward. These cons are very high impact -- I would rate the employer as a 3.5 given the choice, but decided to err to 3 stars because of the gravity of these cons. Advice to Management:Create clear goals to be promoted or gain raises. Institute a COLA raise for contract employees.

CW's Beware.,"IT Analyst in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Great, only if you are a 3Mer. I've heard about all the wonderful benefits and pay a full time 3M employee receives. It almost sounded too good to be true. It could have been a dream job. Cons:CW's are treated as sub humans. If 3M could have found a machine to do your job you wouldn't be there in the first place. You don't matter, and you will be reminded in subtle and not so subtle ways regularly. Don't fall for the lie that you are going to get hired soon. There is a good chance you will hear this repeatedly to keep you on the hook so you stay. The fact is you will work hard and waste years diligently, constantly proving yourself only to be reminded you are not a 3Mer. YOU ARE NOT ONE OF US CW. You can't participate in so many things as a result of being a CW, you get isolated. 3M Club? No, CW's can't be a part of that ""Enhancing 3M Culture since 1934"" club. That culture is exclusive, only for 3Mers. This is what an inclusive place for all looks like? What it looks like is alienation. Advice to Management:3M talks big about diversity and inclusion, how about including CW's then? STOP allowing managers and supervisors to deceive CW's into thinking they are going to be hired. STOP with these blatant, willful, deliberate lies about becoming a 3M FTE. STOP distinguishing your CW's from your FTE's. Putting CW at the end of their name and email address is demoralizing. This doesn't make them feel good about themselves or what they do for you. The fact 3M feels a need to do this to single them out is borderline discriminatory. Practice what you preach, show some gratitude to these people who work so hard for you everyday, hoping to be hired. STOP creating, fostering and promoting the Us vs Them mentality CW's are forced to endure.",1,2022-03-16T00:00:00.000Z,61269266

Company You Can Retrire From - 3M HIS,"Anonymous Employee in Atlanta, GA","Pros:The 3M is a large company with many segments. The 3M HIS provides decent benefits and as a family like culture approach in most cases. There are many associations that cater to every race and gender. The company loves diversity and inclusion. Cons:There are many opportunites, but you must network and build strong relationships with people in order to move up into management positions. Just like anywhere you will work. Understand there is a work culture that you should follow. Being a Black Man in this company can have some challenges if you are trying to move into management. PEOPLE have to like you AND TRUST YOU ;) You will have to opportunites to learn a lot of information more than you will at any other company, could be overwheleming. Please try to join some of the associations they may have, these could help in getting some good advice on how to move into management. But, in most cases moving up will involve just waiting your turn, hopefully :( I have worked in many IT areas at 3M HIS where I was the only black man, but was always treated with respect. Just trying to move into upper management is super hard, maybe impossible. My advice to Black Men working here, please use Emotional Intelligence, you will need it. Advice to Management:Please, please, please do everything you can to get more blacks (men) into upper management, if they have the credentials and ready, promote them and provide the necessary support.

3M Management needs retraining on 3M culture and values,"Specialist Scientist in Saint Paul, MN",Pros:Work-life balance policy. Good family leave program for those having kids. Cons:I’ve recently seen several high performers be on the layoff list with 1-2 years before retirement. Not in fitting with 3M values! Core culture aspects have shifted and backstabbing is rewarded and the way to get ahead instead of collaborating. Advice to Management:Many long time (15+ year) employees are fed up and burnt out. The culture has changed and become cut throat. Divisional Leadership don’t appear to care about their employees and leadership is not being transparent. Employees have lost trust in leadership and are looking elsewhere. It’s sad to see current leadership forgetting core values and practices that made 3M great and I hope they correct course soon before the damage is permanent. New programs are aimed at benefitting workers under 35 and long time 3M employees that didn’t have those benefits get to pick up the slack. Management needs to look at policies that benefit workers at every life stage. No loyalty to those employees who have spent their whole career at 3M.,3,2022-01-26T00:00:00.000Z,58590479

Toxic/Deceiving Bottom of the Totem Pole Role,"Patient Support Specialist in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:You’re compensated well, great benefits, and given a company car. Cons:The PSS role is a mandatory two year role with virtually no work life balance. You basically are constantly on call but not in a fun or fulfilling way. Weekend calls/emails will exclusively consist of paperwork and dealing with problems/impossible timelines. It’s marketed as a “sales” role but it is almost exclusively a paper pushing sales support role. It’s a role where you’re constantly painted as the bad guy to the healthcare workers you interact with and it’s quite common your phone calls immediately ruins their day (they will not be shy with letting you know this). Because the revenue you bring in isn’t nearly as large as the legitimate med sales reps, management doesn’t always care or attempt to recognize when you’re performing well or overachieving. Other teams may be different but my current manager does nothing to invest in my future or growth as a sales rep. Ultimately I feel as though everyone in this position wants to leave it as soon as possible but management won’t want to promote you if you’re stable given the role is so undesirable and unfulfilling. My advice to anyone considering this role is to be fully aware that it’s primarily not a selling role, you will have to work every weekend/holiday, “unplugging” on vacation is almost impossible, and you will be stuck in the role for a minimum of two years before you’re eligible to be promoted. You are unapologetically the bottom of the totem pole. Also keep in mind the turnover rate for the role is astronomical at the 2 year mark (you’re basically gambling that you’ll be promoted and then move companies if you’re not). Advice to Management:Advertise that the PSS role is NOT primarily a selling role and make it abundantly clear to employees who are preforming well that they are on track to move up into a real selling role. Show more appreciation for the long hours/weekends/holidays the employees in this role have to put in. Treat the role as a stepping stone position rather than a bait-and-switch one.",1,2022-01-09T00:00:00.000Z,57650411

Decisions are made with a complete lack of transparency and you can never trust that follow through will happen. Expectations that US employees must be available and work around the clock which causes burnout and resentment. Continual leaning of the workforce and refusal of leadership to prioritize means many employees are doing the job of multiple people while also wasting their time on initiatives that will never come to fruition. HR is a joke. Promotions are purely political and terrible managers are tolerated for years. Real diversity will never happen; as a former manager, I know they have no actionable plan to accomplish it. Advice to Management:Listen to your employees and resource your true priorities. Try to distinguish between the glad-handers and the people actually getting work done. Value experience, accomplishments and expertise over buzzwords. You do not know what Agile means. Try to figure it out. Get rid of all the crappy executives who have no idea what they’re doing. You are hemorrhaging talent because of poor leadership.

At the same time 3M does have some great benefits and is committed to supporting the employees.

Miserable,"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Getting the brand name on your resume. Pay and benefits seem relatively competitive. Some really great people. Cons:Slow moving, bureaucratic, and nearly entirely driven by internal political games. The majority of management within 3M is made up of ""lifers"" who have been here for upwards of 30 years, most riding out a pension, who are unwilling to let go of outdated and ineffective methods of operating. It is next to impossible to get up to speed quickly as a new employee at 3M due to the sheer size and the disorganized complexity that is the organizational structure. Unless you get lucky enough to know someone who knows someone, you'll never be able to get what you need to do your role successfuly day to day. Transparency is entirely absent, critical decisions are consistently made behind closed doors leaving out any opportunity for feedback from vested parties who will end up being affected. Lack of communication is rampant and results in constant project delays, scope misalignment, and a persistent lack of trust between employees and their chain of management. Effective prioritization and project managment is nowhere to be found. Prioritization does not seem to be taken seriously and is completely devoid of reason, priorities are changing so often and so inconsistely nothing can ever be fully accomplished. Every shift happens at break neck speed and is always something reactionary to achieve short term goals, and never proactively looking at what long term consequences they will have to the business. To say 3M is practing Agile in any meaning of the word is comical. Top talent is being hemorrhaged left and right and it's only getting worse as time goes on. This is creating a snowball effect that is causing remaining employees toughing it out to be overburdened without any type of acknowledgment or assistance in terms of compensation or additional resources. Burn out can be seen at every turn and I fear what that will mean long term for the health of the business. Advice to Management:Please take this honest feedback to heart and do what you can to drive change from within. As countless other reviews have stated, trust in your employees, listen your employees, and know that even though this may seem harsh many of us truly want to help 3M suceed. We are not given the proper outlets to express these types of concerns, you're not going to hear this type of feedback when it's being cycled through layers upon layers of middle managers. The unfortunate reality is, without anonymity, you will never get the feedback you really need to hear to succeed.",1,2021-11-30T00:00:00.000Z,56068288

Experiencing management crisis,"Advanced Product Development Specialist in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:3M has some incredibly smart scientists and engineers. There are many diverse markets and technologies to suit any career interests. Cons:Management from the top down is failing employees and shareholders. 3M is being seriously mismanaged. Top employees and experienced employees are leaving or have left, leaving more work piled on top of fewer and fewer workers with less and less experience. It's a terrible feedback loop. Advice to Management:Stop creating new flavor-of-the-day initiatives. After prioritizing, resource accordingly. Stop promoting bad managers. It's okay to fire bad people and develop good people. 3Ms greatest blind spot is that it thinks it has ""world class manufacturing"" when there is little incentive for the smartest people to work in manufacturing instead of research and development. Get rid of old, stale management styles (and people) and welcome a more agile approach to business.",2,2021-11-22T00:00:00.000Z,55724495

Cons:Some individuals at this location are very cruel, and rude to new employees trying to learn new responsibilities. There is much favoritism, and bias 3M Plant location. There are many employees at this location that belong to the United Steelworkers Union that are allowed to break rules and management looks the other way. However newcomers if they violate any of these rules they are screened at, and threatened. You cannot have two sets of rules. Management does not set good examples at this 3M Plant location. I was doing well in my duties and responsibilities at this location. I was told twice by management, and by the union president to apply for a permanent position. When I did apply then the company told me on their website that they would not offer me a permanent position. If you did not want to hire me permanently why was I told twice to apply. This does not make sense and is totally unprofessional. Advice to Management:I would advise management to dismiss one of their supervisors. This individual is a very angry, and very unstable individual. He does not work well with any individual at this location, and has no professional people skills.

The people who handled the tools and assembled all the parts to create a whole. We make what you design! You seem to forget that.

One of the worst working cultures I’ve worked for and if you are smart, ambitious, have good ideas, are younger or a minority this place is not for you. Find an employer that practices what they preach and has technology and processes that don’t live in the 90’s. There is little to no transparency so things are disjointed all of the time. There isn’t a whole lot of communication so people are working 24/7 but I’m not sure on what because you don’t see a whole lot of results. But everyone is exhausted. I’ve never been more stressed out over daily work than I have here. Your health and well being are worth more than a paycheck.

In the chase for shareholder value, company forsake strategy, innovation, localisation, empowerment, transform company into top-down business-led culture for technology company. Cons:Plenty. R&amp;D measured using Salesforce=No more smart goals setting. Just rely on your sales partner for your performance rating=performance rating not based on own performance, but dependent on others. Regionalised reporting structure means limited career opportunities. Subsidiaries with smaller sales volume may never get promoted. Advice to Management:Wake up. The current direction will make the company end up weaker than during McNerney's term. All the efforts to bring back the innovation essence by Buckley has been completedly eroded. Compare european companies with US companies and you will see how lacking a long term strategy slowly brings the company down. Look at the big auto firms, why german autos are selling like hot cakes, but US autos are not? German CEOs stay around for 10-20 year terms. US CEOs only stay a few years as Wall street wants to see numbers quickly. A strategy will surely but slowly bring numbers up, but no strategy will surely but slowly bring numbers down. US companies board of directors need to rethink what they are doing. Otherwise, very soon the big MNC names are left with only the europeans, joined by new chinese ones. US MNCs really need to wake up. The world used to follow what the US market had. Now the Asian market dictates what the rest of the world wants, so US MNCs cannot stay US-centric for product development. Look at Dyson.

Not a family company,Operator,"Pros:Triple pay for holidays. Vacation time when you start. Cons:There is zero work/life balance. They do not care if you have a family, scheduled appointments or obligations outside of work. They expect you to cancel if you are forced in on OT and to always put the company first, even above your family. One of several examples: if your child is sick and you need to call in, you have to say that YOU are sick. You can't say that your child is sick or you won't be allowed the time off. The converting department is one of the most toxic in the building which is why they struggle to keep the dept. staffed. The gossip makes the environment hard to work in. In addition to associates, some of the group leads gossip openly and within ear shot about associates they don't care for despite the company posters everywhere about gossip and acting professional. Associates are incredibly hard on (almost to the point of bullying) - those hired off the street that didn't have to go through the temp agency (Volt) and management does nothing to address this ongoing issue. With that said, associates that have been there longer will be heard over you, even if they're dishonest. You ca do and act any way you wish if you've been there a long time and not be held accountable. You have no voice with anyone until you've been there a few years. Management doesn't like to address issues. There's more of an interest in making the problem go away than there is in fixing it. Only come to them with department ideas and never come to them with problems that need addressing. If you're ever accused of something there, just take your lickings and move on, even if you didn't do it. They like smooth sailings and will see you as a problem if you disrupt that for them. Advice to Management:Could be a good place to work if management were more professional and utilized a spine when it came to addressing issues as opposed to brushing the issues under the carpet as to not have to deal with them. If confrontation and dealing with issues are intimidating for you, you shouldn't be in management.",1,2021-03-28T00:00:00.000Z,44687193

Don't waste your time,Billing Specialist,"Pros:Management and coworkers were all nice people Cons:Atrocious onboarding, constant calls to IT, ridiculous overtime requirements, management seemed spread thin and constantly confused Advice to Management:Please, for the sake of new employees, fix your onboarding process. I spent my entire first month on the phone with I.T. (per my manager's instructions) trying to set up the majority of their many programs (Delair, Hero, etc.) So much training time was wasted in the week long class alone, as almost everyone had issues. Most people in my class weren't even in my department. This greatly hindered productivity and furthermore, requiring overtime is absolutely ludicrous when your regular shift is spent waiting around for I.T. to return your call (which they frequently did at 4AM). I was never once warned that once the position turns permanent, you're expected to work OT without exception. Sometimes even receiving emails the Friday evening before people began their OT the following Monday. I left for a multitude of reasons after an entire month of red flags. Management seems nice but expects a LOT with little regard to work-life balance. Unless you want to spend your time struggling with software to the point of being in tears, don't waste your time. When I brought these issues to light, I was met with constant empty statements such as ""hang in there!"" As you can tell by this review, I found it completely fruitless to ""hang in there."" One day I'll look back and laugh at the incompetence but for now, I fear for the new bright-eyed temps and employees who are looking for honest work without being exploited. The generation of people who expect direct communication in lieu of wavering, false positivity. The generation of people who don't wish to logon to Microsoft Teams to see memes making light of mandatory OT, while accompanying this unprofessionalism with baleful emails claiming no exceptions will be made for anyone. This is a monopoly, and one you won't win unless you're CEO making at least six figures. What a joke. (I'll probably still buy their scotch tape though)",1,2021-03-09T00:00:00.000Z,43724069

Advice to Management:Dear Mike (Roman), The Advance 3M as a unified operating model is a neat idea, and I had great hopes for it. The problem is that 3M decisions were already too slow, and are now even slower. Senior leaders are making even more decisions well BELOW their pay grades. L2 executives/Vice Presidents running multi-billion dollar divisions should not be making one thousand dollar decisions! I did not think the level of appearance-based political micromanagement at 3M could get worse, but you actually accomplished it, congratulations. As you can tell, 3M middle management and senior technical corps (T5/JG 14 to L3) have been fully demotivated and disillusioned. Those that the company has not already laid off are heading for the exits. Dear 3M competitors, If you ever wanted to go about poaching top talent out of 3M, now is the time. You will find that many 3Mers that previously said they would never, ever leave the company are actively looking. Dear new grads, 3M is a great place to start, just understand that in order to advance more than 1 or 2 promotions you will probably need to leave.

It allows to focus more on customer problems rather than worrying if our product will perform to the customer's standards or not. Lots of opportunities and 3M actually promotes you to try different roles to help you grow your career. Cons:Too many systems that are usually not connected to each other, creating more admin work. Too many job overlaps meaning there are usually 10 people that will want to do the same job, creating too much internal politics, slows the process down instead of accelerating things. Digital adaptation is extremely slow. Too much product training. I would prefer to focus your sales people on certifications as they can help the individuals in their career long-term, but inside or outside 3M. Once they have acquired these certification, accelerate their pay straight-away. You would then end up with staff that are compensated for acquiring more knowledge. Like Richard Branson once said, ""Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they don't want to."" Too much internal chatter. I feel internal meetings' audiences should be limited to only the people that would benefit from the meeting. Big 250+ audiences I feel are unnecessary, spending over 20% per week in most cases on meetings alone, especially during the pandemic lockdown! My suggestion is to cascade the message through your managers, then ONLY IF NECESSARY, set up meetings with your team but with a 'narrowed-down' tone. If it can't be done in an email, don't take your staff's time on an hour's worth of meetings. In my role in Sales, the Activity Metrics are just numbers and I feel the wrong metrics are measured (in most cases). Quantity is measured more than Quality therefore if not done carefully, it can have a negative impact on the staff as they will be driven in the wrong direction. I also feel the the 3M Culture of leadership behaviours are great, but because the managers do not measure it, it becomes nothing but buzz words, especially 'Foster Collaboration and Teamwork'. The current Advance 3M model should promote interconnectivity globally to help us become much more productive and would ensure that our customers are assisted in the quickest, most efficient way possible. Stop giving people jobs for the sake of creating a job but we should utilise the fantastic global resources we have available! Advice to Management:Manage the staff rather than saying 'oh this is what we have to do because that's the decision from the top-down'. Happy employees are more productive but if we keep doing things because that's what we are told to do, without justification, then it becomes just another corporate company. I would also suggest to give your staff the freedom to be creative, be innovative rather than telling them protocols (as long as they are not breaking the rules obviously). Again, ""Train people well enough so they can leave. Treat them well enough so they don't want to.""",4,2021-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,43133179

Innovative Playground but with Toxic Features,Advanced Product Development Specialist,"Pros:3M is an amazingly innovative company. As a scientist, working at 3M is like being a kid living in a toy store. It's a wonderful feeling being a part of world-class innovation. I absolutely love the work I do, and it's a real thrill to develop exciting products alongside other passionate scientists and engineers. Cons:Unfortunately, 3M seems to have some major faults, especially in today's sociopolitical climate. It's hard to write this, but it's important to share. From my point of view as a scientist and product developer, 3M seems to care more about its shareholders and its managers than it does about the people inventing and manufacturing the products that make our company relevant. This is a sad situation and I think 3M can do better. The first step is acknowledging some of its many serious missteps: 3M cut jobs and salaries during the pandemic, but somehow had plenty of cash to pay out as dividends to rich investors on Wall Street. This makes very little sense from an organizational health perspective. And it makes even less sense from a social justice perspective where income inequality is such a strong forced for much of the negativity we see in the US right now. Furthermore, 3M promotes and rewards managers who lay off productive and valuable workers with no regard for the pandemic-rattled job market. Leadership would do better by 3M to adopt a Stakeholder Mindset. 3M claims to be an inclusive company committed to sustainability and equality, but continues to reward career sharks who stifle truly sustainable innovation and the diverse people who drive that innovation. 3M cancels programs and stifles innovations that offer true sustainability (even ones with objectively excellent profitability) in favor of gratuitously high and unsustainable profit margins. 3M further rewards the same lock-step managers who feed this toxic culture, and stifles the careers of those who try to make a positive impact to our global society. As a scientist and global citizen, it is incredibly hard to see this happening at such an ostensibly progressive company like 3M. While 3M is truly excellent at charitable donations around the world, there are serious internal problems with diversity and inclusion. I applaud 3M's philanthropy, and hope to see improvements in culture internally. For example, while we do have quite a few underrepresented groups in leadership roles, many of these people have the same career shark mentality that prevents the people they're representing in their demographic from thriving and attaining similar success. Now, this message board ensures that ""each employer has the right to respond to a review left by a member for free, and that the employer be given the last word on a review."" I enthusiastically invite a response to this thoughtful review - with the counterargument that our planet, 3M's employees and customers, and humanity's global society always have the last word. 3M needs to do better. The good news is that we can do better. We have many excellent people. We just need to have the right people in leadership roles. Suggestions are provided below. Advice to Management:1. We need a flatter organization where toxic leadership has nowhere to hide. 2a. We have too much turnover in middle management, to the point that the people running important businesses and laboratories simply don't understand the businesses or labs they are running. Self-promoting behavior and short-sighted decisions leading to poor growth and lack of morale are the long-lasting consequences of this. 2b. If we continue allowing this kind of turnover in leadership, then we need our leaders to have a transparent and traceable track record of successes and failures to discourage myopic and unsustainable business strategies. 3. Our people need a clear and measurable path to success - not an opaque machination wherein director-level leaders determine the success or failure of their employees' careers on personal whim. 4. We need an HR organization that works to make 3M's systems benefit everyone's career, not just the managers. 5. Finally, we need to take innovation seriously. Class 4+ innovation requires consistent financial commitment, organizational alignment, championing, and most importantly rewards and career advancement for the hard-working people who advance those innovations. Class 4+ innovation does not always lead to commercialized products. But the IP and internal knowledge generated in the process is still valuable - and it needs to be rewarded if 3M wants its strong community of scientists and engineers to take intelligent risks at high-growth-potential Class 4+ programs. 6. Stop buying back shares of stock. This is completely antithetical to organic growth. Instead, invest money in employees' careers, in R&amp;D, in go-to-market strategies, and in strategic acquisitions. 7. Tie raises and Annual Incentive Pay (called bonuses in other companies) to dividend dispersals. If 3M can afford to pay cash to investors, then 3M can properly reward the hard-working people who created that value in the first place.",1,2021-02-17T00:00:00.000Z,42649831

Solution Architect,"Solution Architect in Maplewood, MN","Pros:One of a handful of vertically integrated manufacturing companies left in US.

If you're a mildly risk averse millennial who values stability and the chance for lifelong employment like the days of old, there is no better place. Incentive structure is very generous in this regard, promotes employment longevity and cross-training. Cons:Insular isolationist culture, does not look outwards enough for new ideas, technologies, processes. ""We are 3M and do things different"" prevents a lot of technology adoption that would be considered common place.

"Brilliant People, Antiquated Corporate Policies","Senior Automation Engineer in Silver Spring, MD","Pros:- Some of the most amazing and intelligent Engineers I've ever had the pleasure of working with have been on my team and sister teams - HIS Division functions a bit like a start-up : laid back, able to control your own sprint items/research items, lots of freedom with AWS/tech stacks (although that can be from team to team) - Decent Healthcare - Time off is lackluster unless you get a boost because of where you live, then it's awesome - Sick time is pretty stellar - 401K Match is decent + StockOptions are a nice perk - Most of the functional teams who lack the software/cloud knowledge are really trying to come up to speed; there are lot of good people working really hard to grow/be better in the software cloud space. (But, lots of managers who aren't want to put down others and get defensive). Cons:- Still a pretty heavy white Boys club, especially in upper management. There are some female/non-white/non-binary faces, but not enough throughout the org, ESPECIALLY in engineering - The Job function structure is opaque, I've interviewed people who were to be in a grade above me with less experience in my skill set - A lot of the brilliant engineers I've worked with are actually Contractors/employees of Stelligent, so they don't stick around - 3M HIS seems to have trouble hiring/finding talent for some reason--HR I think doesn't know how to recruit Software Engineering folks, so a lot of Managers and team leads are doing double duty finding people. Hiring process is SUppppppper slow/drawn out/unorganized so we lose candidates before we can even interview them - Definite disconnect between the actual engineers and management who controls our destiny (I get the sense that no one read my resume/I've gotten silo-ed/forgotten) - Corporate policies are still not quite there with functioning like a software company - There's no on-call : the reason this is a negative is because they haven't designed it yet. The teams are really advanced/accelerated in some aspects and in the dark ages in others. (Advance CICD/IaC, yet no ops support, and the cloud security team is completely lost).I can see this coming back to bite 3M when the SLAs/apps get more attention by users. Some managers are trying to fix this. . . - whenever corporate networking has to get involved, it's a power struggle. They don't understand cloud and generally behave like the 1990s with IP space requests; there's a definite sense of some teams feeling threatened outside our little engineering/devops bubble - education reimbursement is pint-sized compared to company size Advice to Management:- Take care of the talent you already have, ensure they are happy/well cared for - Get a better recruitment team - Corporate is getting there with adopting cloud/software company mindset, but it's slow going, need more of a company educational adoption some employees can get there too! - pay scale needs an adjustment - make the position/pay grade structure less opaque to ensure fairness/mobility - Promotion structure is also somewhat vague/opaque and needs clarity - Hiring more Diverse Talent!!",3,2021-01-22T00:00:00.000Z,41257756

They do not have a modern selling or marketing strategy, very ""old-school"". Advice to Management:Understand younger employees. Give them incentives to stay at 3M (financial and opportunities). Quit announcing massive layoffs just to slot those same 30+ year employees into every open position. In the US, 3M has decided incentivizing sales reps is not necessary (""due to ERP system change"") and this has severely hurt sales rep morale and productivity.

Good Company,"Design Engineer in Austin, TX","Pros:3M has a great company culture. Everyone seems to uphold the companies values and in my two years working there I have not met anyone I wouldn't want to work with again. It is a large company so there is some ""Bureaucracy"" but I have never found it to hinder my job. The thing I like most about 3M is their flexibility in working and their willingness to do what is best for the employees and company rather than just the shareholders like many other companies in todays world. They are very ""conservative"" in their approach so don't expect crazy high salaries and crazy new world perks(like unlimited PTO, drinking at work, constant parties) but I have found everything about my job and its benefits to be fair or better than average. The most surprising thing to me about 3M is how many employees have been there 20, 25, 30+ years and still love their job, I think that is a testament to how well 3M treats their people. Cons:I really cant think of very many cons. As mentioned before it is a large company so somethings are slower to move and you are usually defined by your role so if you want to do a lot of random unrelated things it might be tough too. Vacation is probably very industry appropriate but can feel like less compared to some other companies.

"Motivation killer, toxic working environment","Website Analyst in Bracknell, England","Pros:Mostly respectful of the working hours, some nice colleagues Cons:The environment in the company was far from ideal making even permanent people want to change jobs. Some employees found it acceptable to do minimal work and mostly spy over other people's screens to check what they were doing. The culture of the company was to mostly follow methods, plans or ideas that were so outdated they wouldn't make sense. Yet, most people seemed hardly willing or open to change, or to doing anything differently or more efficiently. Overall, it was really unpleasant to work in such an environment. Advice to Management:Start carrying out some serious performance reviews and start adopting some innovation in the company's culture and not just the products.",1,2020-11-19T00:00:00.000Z,38509971

Great industry experience for undergrads,"Technical Aide in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:I started working at during summer of Senior year. I applied online and got an interview weeks later. The offer didn't come until 3 months after I interviewed on-site due to hiring freeze. The good thing about working as a tech aide is you'll get industry experience on some of the most advance and very interesting technology that 3M has. The work can vary depends on who your manager is and which group you end up working for. Work will mainly be in a lab environment supporting staff scientists. It's a good way to get your foot in the door and learn some of the technology. Cons:They cap working hours for tech aide at 900 hours per year and no more than 32 hours per week. You have to work out your work hours with your manager. Generally, when school is not in session (i.e. summer), you get to work 4 days a week. During school year, depending on your schedule, you can work up to 32 hours a week (but remember you cannot go over 900 hours per year total). There is not overtime for this position. Getting a full-time position is extremely difficult. Basically, the application pool (both internally and externally) is very competitive. Start networking with different people within your department and other department so you can get an idea of what full-time position/area you want to work on after graduation. Most of the job you ended up applying for or interviewed for will be cancelled due to business circumstances or on hold because the hiring managers already have someone in mind even before posting the jobs.",4,2020-11-16T00:00:00.000Z,38391672

I would have very much liked to stay there if I hadn't been let go when my Business Group was not removed and merged into two others. Cons:While I was not a fan of my second boss, it had more to do with difference in personality types than a bad management environment. Other than that, I suppose there is a culture of taking on contractors for very long periods of time. The uncertainty is frustrating, but I was paid very well, and believe that is part of the reason why they have such a solid workplace. They only take you on once they are sure of you.

No ISR makes “Plan”-Commissions are BS,"Inside Sales Representative in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Decent culture in the company at large. Almost cult like the positivity people exhibit about being there. The company does a good job of making you proud of being a 3mer. Cons:Before I start, let’s start with a simple presumption, “Sales people want to make money. The harder they work, and more success they have, the more money they should make.” This is NOT the premise the entire Inside Sales Dept. follows. If you are looking for the premise above, look elsewhere. If you are fine putting in a decent amount of hard work, keep your head down, have no drive to make 6 figures, and instead are cool with a annual 2% raise in your base salary to have a shot in 3 years of a 10-15% raise into a higher level ISR. Sign up for this “sales” job...which really is a glorified order taker or account manager. It is a high base salary 65-75k account manager role. This is not a professional ISR role in whatever dept you end up in. The commission plans are inept. No one “makes plan” the commission plan changed 6 times in 12 months. Most of the time we were on guarantee as management had no clue what they were doing. If you want to receive commission, and excel into higher yearly gross...That is NOT the path 3M takes. The Inside Sales department is valued by the company at large and is receiving lots of investment, BUT it doesn’t translate into common sense. No one exceeds plan, no one. That means the plan is BS. It is simply a salaried position and is an embarrassment for a Fortune 100 to state otherwise. But that’s what you get when you have a national inside sales director with no sales experience. See, 3M promotes only from within so they have the same silly po-dunk, middle of the road, conservative ideas that the C-level scientist leaders above then think are sensible. Not one ISR makes above 100k with commissions. Several make 90k as a base salary, but that’s it...there’s no commission happening, maybe 5k annually...is that a sales role? You tell me. Lastly- if you’re a woman or a minority-beware of the grade level they hire you in at...no matter how qualified you are for other roles in the company they have a strict HR rule that limits upward promotion. Dumbest thing I saw was a co-worker, who had more qualifications than most of the competition, was not allowed to sit for interviews with hiring managers that were interested in her, because as a minority she was initially hired in at such an entry level ranking, (way below what she was worth on the open market to save money) and therefore, even though she exceeded the qualifications on the job listing and the managers wanted to interview her, she was denied the change to interview because it beyond 2 steps from her ranking. Total BS for a company that prides itself on diversity. She would have had to leave the company and apply for the job (unlikely to get a call because they prioritize promoting from within), or wait 10 yrs before she is able to interview for the dream position that she is qualified for now...talk about a bunch of middle aged HR/c level white guys golfing on the company course thinking up policies. “But don’t worry we’ll send gobs of promotional emails and team newsletters swearing that we prioritize and appreciate our female and minority colleagues...HAHAHA!” Advice to Management:Look at your high performers...does anyone make commission? Look at your low performers...do they make the same as your high performers while doing wayyy less work? That means your comp structure is broke. “Your annual rating will be different,” is not a good incentive. Salespeople want to make money for what they sell, NOT a silly 2% annual increase.",2,2020-11-02T00:00:00.000Z,37928080

Forces political beliefs on workers,"Operator in Springfield, MO","Pros:A job that pays money Cons:3M is your typical corporation, and for those who have seen the documentary, “The Corporation,” you'll know what I mean. In addition to that, the Springfield plant is no different than any other workplace, especially large factories - favoritism, discrimination, unfairness, backbiting, the good-ole-boy network, good workers are punished, slackers are rewarded, silly rules, rules that are just made up when convenient, wasted time and money, the blame game, and the common mismanagement pretty much sums it up. Compensation needs to be improved, about $5-$10hr more plus profit sharing, since the workers are dealing with deadly chemicals and therefore endangering themselves, their co-workers, and the community. Mandatory overtime can be a problem and you will be expected to work 19 12-hour days straight to meet “business needs.” But they will give you 2 days off only to repeat the 19 days if necessary, because they care about you and your family, so they say. With that said, after nearly 4 years of service I was terminated for not conforming to the political beliefs of 3M that were being forced upon the workers. For the last 5 months of my employment I put up with the new policies, the signs, the emails, and verbal communications regarding so-called “COVID-19” and didn't dare question any of it, since questioning the Narrative is strictly forbidden. Despite the absurdities, the lies, the insults, the guilt-tripping, and all of us being treated like children, I remained quiet and said nothing. Even when some mystery dude came around spraying everything and everybody in the break room while we were trying to eat, I just fled the scene and allowed him to continue. As the mask ritual became the latest brainwashing campaign, 3M Springfield brought this charade into the plant and distributed masks for voluntary use, twice, which I simply ignored as did everyone else. At this point I became concerned because I knew the Plan was calling for mandatory participation, so my dignity line was drawn. Being forced to wear some dehumanizing mask that marks my acceptance of an immoral agenda and implies I am contaminated and that my co-workers are contaminated crosses that line, and I refuse to be disrespected and degraded by selfish, unloving people who simultaneously puff themselves up to be virtuous, be it 3M or anywhere else. After the mandatory mask announcement I requested a personal leave of absence with 3M Springfield HR due to religious objections to wearing a mask for this purpose. After supposedly discussing with “the team” for over a week, the HR manager and whoever is on this team, as expected, did not approve the leave, did not offer an accommodation, and would not let me in the plant without a mask even though I was willing and able to work, so the official termination is blamed on absenteeism. Most people are aware that this mask agenda has nothing to do with health and safety, no matter how much the order-followers lie and chant their mantra, but rather compliance, conditioning, symbolism, ritual, and superstition. If anyone desires to work with 3M, or any other large corporation, be prepared to be treated like a dumb animal because the mask is only the beginning, so it may be best to just avoid the trap and not even give these seared-conscience people the satisfaction of forcing their inhumane beliefs upon you. Advice to Management:Do not discriminate. Do not force your political beliefs on the workers. Question and research the Narrative.",1,2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z,35414401

A Cesspool of corruption and revolving door,"Warehouse Worker in DeKalb, IL","Pros:The pay and benefits are greater than other places in the area...not really saying much.. Cons:Forced Overtime is a major problem here, especially during the summer. They do not know how to staff correctly to obtain a good work/life balance. Warehouse workers are forced to endure long hours, short breaks and lunch periods, favoritism, awful treatment from unqualified leads, terrible supervisors, unbelievably complacent HR, an awful and inaccurate productivity system. They don't listen to any ideas or improvements, and constantly blame warehouse workers for their ineptitude in the office and poor warehouse management systems. All decisions are made by those who have never worked in the warehouse, and frankly, do not care about us at all. When the pandemic hit, we were declared essential workers and forced into ridiculous safety protocols, but no haz pay. They don't even care if we die. There is no recognition at all. Those who try to work hard are not rewarded. Most of the people who don't work get better positions and higher pay. It is all about kissing butt. It is a dead end job really. Communication is pretty much non-existent. Upper management all the way down to lead operators all need basic communication classes, psycho therapy, and taught how to treat people in a decent manner. The warehouse management systems they use are slow and buggy. They also use outdated equipment that is used 24 hours a day/7 days a week. All in all... Stay away from here... Advice to Management:Warehouse workers are human beings and deserve to be treated like it.. If we are in a Pandemic, we are in danger. No Haz pay and no recognition is a slap in the face as well as despicable. Evaluate your management more often, and listen to your employees on the front line.",1,2020-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,34684934

Fantastic company for those who mean serious business,"Marketing Manager in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:What I like the most about working at 3M is all the incredibly smart, hard-working people you get to meet and work with. There's not a lot of time or money spent in frivolities here, so if you want silly perks, huge admerch budgets and a lot of fun &amp; games, this is definitely NOT the place for you. On the other hand, if you're not intimidated by science, you want to learn a lot, get your hands dirty and handle very complex products often harshly challenged by cheaper, crappier versions of them, this is the place for you. People in general are very nice and you can make friends here however. If you're smart and work hard, you will find a lot of opportunities to grow, but they seldom come to knock at your door. You have to network and sell yourself, which is very hard for some of us and very easy for those who often deserve less. Overall, a great company, more diverse than most because it's Global, but with work to do in the diversity department still. Cons:2 things: - I wish 3M tried harder to detect and recognize work truly well done and good employees. In general (there are exceptions), if you're not as talented a self-promoter as you are an employee, don't play the squeaky wheel game wisely or have an Ivy League education, you might be eternally overlooked for promotions or sexier assignments (my boat is more rocked by increasing responsibilities than increasing pay, but that's me), no matter what your successes and accomplishments are. This can be especially true with women and minority employees. In the company there are still big pockets with a total old boys' club mentality - I wish creativity and thinking outside the box was rewarded and encouraged beyond the R&amp;D functions. Considering our budgets, it is very important to be creative in all functions, especially Marketing. We need more doers and more people willing to think and do things differently. Advice to Management:- Find and reward good performance properly. - BEWARE the sociopath of the species: One would be too many, but in reality there are many people in leadership positions who are downright sociopaths. They thrive by ""managing up"" but they are often incompetent at anything else but manipulation, and wreak havoc down below to the point that great employees get their spirit broken and leave the company or end up with PTSD. Believe me, whatever the cost of detecting them and getting rid of them is, it is absolutely worth it, based on the destruction and chaos they cause in entire organizations.",5,2020-07-08T00:00:00.000Z,34126326

Sadly going downhill,"Project Manager in Bracknell, England","Pros:Many kind, intelligent people striving for job satisfaction and to hang on to the brilliant culture 3M had a decade ago Depending on who you work for, generally you can be fairly autonomous and work flexibly - this has been highly important during COVID-19 Plenty of opportunity to make a difference - unfortunately I tend to work on 'pet' projects with no opportunity to sustain the gains due high staff turnover/transition Family orientated and making more effort to educate around wellbeing Job security relatively (I'm a new mum so this is important at the moment) Cons:Old boys club mentality at the top Many old-timers have golden handcuffs (final salary pensions) or are hanging n for redundancy...otherwise known as 'dead wood' which slows everyone else down Organisation increasingly working in silo's making job progression challenging Job opportunities inconsistently advertised - especially as you get more senior its more about who you know.

There are many resources (people and operations) available to provide expertise and support for overcoming hurdles. Cons:The culture of 3M has become bureaucratic and rigid, with a greater focus on cost reduction. At least this was my experience in the division I worked in. I have heard there are cultural differences across divisions. Micro-management via daily tier board meetings are not conducive to a positive work environment. There are black belts distributed throughout the company serving a 2 year assignment with the expectation of delivering a given cost savings. This generally creates competitive friction across the division.

A company that sacrifices retention to avoid confronting their shortcomings,"Engineer in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Job flexibility, room for career advancement, helpful and knowledgeable people Cons:Diversity, change, high turnover for new hires, vacation time for new hires could be more competitive Advice to Management:As a company that seems to preach diversity to its investors, and fund many diversity related functions, the initiatives within the company to promote diversity where its most needed are lacking at best. 3M often puts a large sum of money into conferences such as SWE, but doesn't always have the funds to send their own employees to these events, leaving a disconnect between what they appear to value and how they demonstrate their values. In my area of engineering, around 90% of employees are white men. There is a large initiative to hire more diverse candidates, but the company fails to realize that hiring diverse candidates into a non diverse work culture leads to high turnover. The company needs to roll out mandatory diversity and inclusion discussions and training for all engineering employees if they want to retain any diverse candidates they hire. I have brought this up to HR and I was encouraged to lead this effort on my own, but such a response is putting the burden of change on employees who don't have the bandwidth to lead an additional effort, rather than making a proactive choice and hiring or appointing a team to focus on this issue. With that being said, 3M does do a good job at promoting job flexibility. I do have the option to work from home on days when roads are bad or other reasons prevent me from easily making it into the office.

"Great company with strong values, your career depends on your boss however","Marketing Operations Manager in London, ON","Pros:ethical company with strong value, good quality products, the company cares about its employees, lots of opportunities for advancement, great pay Cons:a lot of politics and your career is in your boss's hands, if they like you- you go far, if they have a problem with you its easy for them to hold you back. sadly too many just care about themselves instead of their people. if your boss fights for you, they can get it but most dont care enough to go to bat. but some do- if you find a good boss who genuinely wants you to grow, you can have an incredible career. also the company spends way too much time worrying about internal optics and doing this with an internal mindset and perspective. The entire business and marketing team will spend 3 weeks preparing slides and excel files for a US VP visit but not spend anywhere nearly as much time and leadership engagement on the customer, in field research etc (politics and internal optics often become more important than the customer and external market). Advice to Management:no employee goes to HR with confidence, they dont tell them anything because its held against them, there isnt a safe trusting place to go. theres a serious problem and nobody hears about it as HR does the exit interviews.... MOC should start listening in on exit interviews when they lose high potential talent.

"Great job, but benefits feel behind the times.","Research Engineer in Minneapolis, MN","Pros:Everyday is exciting with lots of amazing, cutting-edge technology and freedom to pursue new ideas. The people I work with are also great. Cons:Overall the benefits don't feel like they compete well with the other companies where I have peers. They feel like they are the bare minimum to get people to come to the company and stay. Starting with just 2 weeks of vacation and having to wait 4 years to get more just doesn't feel like enough in today's market where I have friends who start with 4 weeks or more. Most of the 2 weeks is quickly used to visit family over holidays if you don't live within driving distance so you spend the entire year getting burned out, or if you don't save vacation for around the holidays you are one of only a few who have to be working over the holidays, which in the team environment makes it difficult to get anything done. The rest of the benefits feel like they are just good enough to make you consider 3M or stay. None lead the industry and it feels like 3M is just barley keeping up with competitors. I would love to see 3M make some changes to lead the industry and be more attractive to newer employees. Something like giving employees one more week of vacation or closing sites the week of Christmas feels like a small sacrifice for the extra satisfaction and appeal the company would have for both new and old employees. I think overall it would make for more productive times at work.",4,2019-12-23T00:00:00.000Z,30992005

Great Experience and Company,Supply Chain Analyst,"Pros:I absolutely loved working for 3M. There is this pride that I would say most employees have working for them because it is such a good company and you get to work on some really cool products that are used every day all over the world. In my personal experience, I always knew my management team had my back and they were excellent coaches and mentors, which can be hard to come by. I was able to work autonomously and create projects I wanted to work on and It was easy to get the resources you needed whether it was in the plant, through sister plants, or though their intracompany website (which is the only company I’ve worked for that I would say had a useful one). In my plant, the systems rarely made intuitive sense, but they worked and we did quite well as far as OTIF and Customer Service levels were concerned, so you could only make things better and more efficient, which is a great position to be in. Lastly, my coworkers were just down to earth. While you always will have the negative folks in any workplace, most people I worked with knew what their goals were and just wanted to achieve them with as little mellow drama as possible and get paid (which 3M also does well). Cons:3M is a baby boomer dressed in millennial's clothing. On the outside they seem really hip and trendy, but you soon learn the inner workings of the company are still that of a behemoth Fortune 500 company; change is hard to push and there is a lot of red tape to get some things approved. My main complaint would be the lack of vacation days provided from the start. I've worked for a lot of different multinational corporations; the ones that are competitive for great employees give at least 3 weeks’ vacation to start with. But, I actually had to give up a week of my vacation time when I joined 3M as they would not negotiate this outdated norm that new employees should only have 2 weeks to start with. This was actually one of my main reasons for leaving the company, as I live across the country from where my family is and I did not get to see them as much as I had before because travel times were just too long to get back home within a 2-3 day weekend. I worked for 3M for over 2 years, and I would have had to wait another 2 just to get that 3rd week. I did get a month of sick days, but I was not allowed to use them for medical appointments, which in 2019 I happened to have a lot of. So, I had to use my vacation time for these. The one time I got to go home in 2019 was for my grandmother's funeral, and I had to beg for 2 days of bereavement leave instead of the allowed 1 to compensate for the travel. I’m not looking for sympathy, I just find it perplexing that a company that says it is as socially responsible as they say they are has not kept up with the times on this policy. I left for a similar sized, well respected company that gave me 3 weeks right off the bat with an additional week of flex holidays. If it weren’t for this con, I would have loved to stay with 3M. Advice to Management:Please, get rid of this old school notion that new employees are undeserving of paid time off.",5,2019-12-04T00:00:00.000Z,30701769

I enjoyed that most of all: working with a team of people that are great at their jobs and work together under somewhat difficult circumstances. You are constantly encouraged to suggest and implement better ways of doing things. Generous paid time off programs too. Cons:Not equipped or willing to properly deal with policy violations by senior managers. Workplace conduct and performance standards are not consistent between hourly/salaried employees. Lack of teamwork between management groups (silos). Improvement process dragged down by hierarchy. Chronically understaffed and this creates unnecessary tension between groups. Just be aware of these things going in. Advice to Management:Be bold! Retaliation is prohibited and must be addressed - even if it is inconvenient. A problem in HR affects all employees. Fix the problem with honesty and integrity and if you can't address it, get help. Your people will respect you for it and stay with the company. Communicate.

"Good compensation package, low/non-competitive salary, no opportunity for growth","Analyst in Albany, NY","Pros:Flexible work arrangements--many people take WFH days or essentially work remotely. Match is 5% on 401k and company gives an additional 3% so it's 8% on 401k. Health is good, get $600 (for individual; family is higher) toward HSA if you take high deductible plan. The work is exceedingly simple and there is minor stress given the lack of challenge. If you work with your ""manager"" (many are really not managers at all...), you can ensure a good work balance and never work more than 40 hours per week. I know people who get their work done in under 40 every single week. If you want to settle for low salary but great benefits and essentially a mindless job that is impossible to get fired from, then sign up. Maternity and paternity leave are good and so many people have a few kids then leave once they don't need/can't use that benefit anymore. Cons:The pay is non-competitive and everyone is guaranteed a 3 (on a 1 to 5 Likert scale) on their performance reviews (which are a complete joke and if they mean nothing, then management should really just get rid of them). This means you can plan on 2% increases forever...until it's ""your turn"" to get a 4 and then you might get 4%. Promotions are rare and people end up leaving after a few years because if you stay here you lose money and become non-competitive in the work force. The people that stay are the lifers who have never had a job outside of Treo/3M (and frankly don't have the skills to be competitive on the market). Do not take a job with 3M thinking you can quickly move up because it's such a big company with tons of opportunity--I see PhDs who are not moving up and are clearly qualified. How is someone with only a college degree supposed to move up?",3,2019-11-23T00:00:00.000Z,30536111

Benefits,"Specialist Master in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Continue to review the benefits program and I can see some improvements up to date. Cons:1. Potential for promotion within a group is almost non existence. You have to switch jobs to get a promotion. For example, a Division supply chain analyst for IATD @ level 10 and can be promoted to a level 11 when you switch jobs to a different division. If a different division is willing to give you a job grade promotion why can't your current division do so. There is no consistency within division when it comes to promotion for the same function. Advice to Management:Look at the the way job promotion occurs at the company. There should be some guidelines and consistency across division to remove the stigma of having to move to a different division to get a job grade promotion.

They also have many resources for you to get information. They pay well in just about any position you hold and they bring resources onsite sometimes which is great! They had a group that gave mammograms in their very nice and equipped RV. Cons:If you are in production you sometimes have to work 12 hour shifts for several weeks and that becomes unsafe. You also don't get much notice. They may tell you an hour before you get off that you have to stay and that isn't really fair and difficult for those that have younger children but you don't get a choice. I would have to say the biggest most important con is that even though they promote themselves as being a top company for hiring those with disabilities, and accommodation for them, they are not as accommodating to those with mental disabilities. In my opinion, it's a lack of knowledge. Advice to Management:I believe 3M should invest in training for their HR and higher management to recognize signs of mental disabilities so they can be part of the solution and not part of the problem.",4,2019-11-12T00:00:00.000Z,30330970

They won't tell you that but the culture will. Politics are of the passive aggressive sort. If you are in the field, it can be nice not to be in HQ but you need to routinely go to St. Paul to be considered and included.

A clear path for advancement, monetary rewards since we no longer offer them Long Term Incentives, a Pension, a better 401K match, etc. Loyalty goes both ways.

A bit antiquated.,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Met a few nice people along the way. Cons:Felt stuck in the late 80s, early 90s business atmosphere. Sales meetings the equivalent of watching on YouTube ""windows 95 launch"" by Microsoft. Old business people talking about collaboration, while VP's host dinner events where they sit in the corner, only talking to people who's job is to tell them how great they are, while they play on their phone. Next, they stand up and work the room as if they were Tony Robbins himself, while pumping up ""thier"" employees about ""collaboration"", then back to their corner for more texting and the bestowing of praise from thier underlings. If the 3M medical experience could be summed up by some of the super lame business buzzwords you will hear, it would be ""A synergistic, robust, collaboration of low hanging fruit, with very little bandwidth "". If you actually like to collaborate with a goal oriented group of people, this is not for you. If you enjoy having a plethora of talking boss chickens, clucking away, while bouncing off of each other to see who can get to that next promotion while stepping over their co-collaborators , this is what you've been looking for.

Contract Work,"Customer Service Representative in Woodbury, MN","Pros:-Laid back environment -Remote work available only after 3 months (if you've proven yourself) Cons:Contract work through an agency.

OK if part of the office/management clique,"Sales in Bracknell, England","Pros:Good work life balance (as long as you are not in sales), 3M uses a time management system (Kronos) which gives days of rest when long hours have been worked; it is frowned upon for sales to use this facility Brand name carries a lot of weight staff care in terms of facilities on site is great, for sales the policy on expenses is poor Good car scheme Cons:Your career is only likely to progress if you live near a major office like Bracknell and if you are part of the office clique. Appointments/promotions are seemingly made based on location and frequency of being in the office and being seen. Sales staff are routinely missed out on promotions to other part of the business or within their group. There is no sales mobility into higher management. Career progression is also based on longevity. you have to be here 20years to see movement and when you do 3M policies restrict large uplifts in salary or position. I got promoted but told pay was restricted to a few % increase despite the job being nationally advertised at a much higher rate. Extremely Bureaucratic with all decisions by committee taking too long for distributors and end users alike. Sales teams are treated like drones rahter than business people, all prcing decisions are made by product/marketing teams who have spent none/little time in the field meeting end users - generally graduates who have entered the company on a management scheme. This means 3M is very un-competitive in the market Inherent arrogance that 3M is the best and clients will come to 3M and that the 3M product is the best on the market. Critiquing or showing issues with the products are frowned upon 3M have a talent development team.... but its not proactive. you can score highly in reviews regularly but no-one reaches out to learn how they can retain or help you develop. they are focused on ""well being"" or other holistic issues rather than actual talent development. People then questions why the good people have left Advice to Management:Proactively engage with staff who are performing, offer recognised, national improvement training (not just 3M learning) such as NVQs, MBAs etc. get the Talent team to develop talent not ""friends""",2,2019-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,27577274

Great company and great culture overall. Lacking inside sales leadership in personal safety division.,Inside Sales Representative,"Pros:One of the best cultures I've worked at in my career. Outside of inside sales I hear its great. Leadership from Mike Roman is solid. Long term career path if you work hard and build a network. Cons:This is specific to inside sales and the current management in place. Management has never been in sales before. yet are in charge of sales. Lack of understanding about sales process and how a sales cycle even works. It has changed from sales performance to metric based ""calls"" and ""correct contacts"" rather than the customer focused top line. Many employees are calling it their call center job because that's where the current manager came from and runs it like that. Micromanagement and low morale haunts pieces of the personal safety division. If you apply go for some area outside of inside sales and you'll be much happier. If you apply for a job outside of the area they will block you from moving on stating its ""a business necessity"" looking at not a personal career move but you are costing them money because they have to hire someone new. Advice to Management:Take a good hard look at who is running your teams and stop treating it like a call center. Distant manager who frequently says one thing and does another. Doesn't lead by example and is basically behind closed doors all day...if even present in the office at all.",4,2019-05-08T00:00:00.000Z,26039464

Very good company,"Slitter Operator in Greenville, SC","Pros:This is a very good company to work for. I've been here for a year and a half. The pay is excellent and most co-workers are friendly. It's possible to move up but takes some time if you're new. Cons:-Swing shift is the worst thing about this company. They talk about safety but yet don't seem to care about our health regarding whether we got enough sleep the previous night or day. Having to work 12 hrs after only getting 4 hours of sleep is not fun. You're either a day shift person or a night shift person, there is no in between. Your body will sleep better on one of those shifts. We could easily go to just 1st, 2nd, or 3rd shift. I understand that the machines have to run 24/7 to make money but this is wear and tear on our body. The people in the office don't understand because they don't have to work it. There are people that have worked here 30+ years and look worn down. I'm not trying to be that person if these hours continue. -Also we are encouraged to put in ideas for improvement but do not get compensated for it. The office gets bonuses for implementing these ideas but we just get a ""Good job"". We are a important piece in this process.

"Pay Well, Old Culture, Poor Leadership","Manager in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Overall, they do pay well with good benefits. The overall base pay is strong, they match 401(k) at varying percentages based on level, offer an employee stock purchase program with a 15% discount and have the standard yearly pay increases Cons:The company is clearly focused on and centered around B2B. They do not understand consumer driven businesses and do not adopt their business models and practices accordingly. If you come from a consumer based company, you will be very disappointed. Marketing budgets are consistently the first area to be cut and the company spends at approximately 1/3 of what other traditional CPG companies spend on marketing. They very much adopt the mindset of 'if you build a better mousetrap'. The company freely moves people in to roles where they have no experience or expertise. While I can appreciate the willingness to allow people to move freely within the company, they assign people to roles based on tenure, not experience or expertise. People with supply chain backgrounds run marketing, customer service backgrounds run sales departments and operations experts work in finance. Without a doubt, the core of this company is built around technical (R&amp;D) and operations. They do not understand nor care about marketing, strategy or sales. While the company claims to be focused on 'growth', all internal indications and behaviors clearly demonstrate they are focused on their historical nature of being a 'dividend' company. The company as a whole is terrible at prioritizing: every project, tactic and strategy is a priority. If you ask what is priority, the most common response will be 'all of them'. This lack of decisions making is consistent up and down leadership levels throughout the company. Very little, if any, decision making and prioritization is driven down in to the organization and employees are not empowered nor entrusted to make key decisions. Because of the historical pension program, the motivation is low among more tenured employees. Many are due to retire in the near future, with those that are near retirement uninterested in new ideas, business strategies or breakthrough innovation. The overall goal is to get to retirement without any significant change. Those with longer tenures do not value outside experience. Their is an unspoken understanding that those with outside experience are known for having 'A3' and 'B3' experience (i.e A.D. and B.C.). Only experience gained with 3M tends to be valued by other 3M'ers who have been with the company for most of their careers. The overall culture focuses on 'checking the box' and 'falling in line with your boss'. While titles appear to show a flat organization, make no mistake, decision making is very much hierarchical. The company needs a complete cultural reset to have a strong chance of succeeding in the future.",1,2019-04-17T00:00:00.000Z,25731006

Hostile Work Environment Food Safety,"Packer in Brookings, SD",Pros:The pay and benefits are good. Cons:Screamed at daily by coworkers and threatened to be written up. Objects ripped out hands and being physically shoved out of the way. Supervisor and hr informed about work situation and did nothing. There is no teamwork. Operators think they are entitled not to do work and to change schedules at random. Other team members below operator can high jack teams as they please. There is a complete lack of communication from management and crews are left short handed with no help (Other departments fire people for not filling in these spots). One crew leaves early and the next crew is expected to make up their work. One lead has two daughters below her in the same department and allows them to act as leads in her stead. Overall it’s been a nightmare and the plant here doesn’t treat their people like human beings anymore. Advice to Management:The abuse and entitlement needs to stop. People need treated as human beings. Your not going to keep people treating them poorly.,1,2019-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,25224852
19 years strong and going....,"Project Manager in Maplewood, MN","Pros:There's a reason I've been here 19 years. I can assure you that this company cares about it's employees. And whether or not it's apparent, cares tremendously about the environment, community and products it offers. The pay is competitive, the flexibility is a tremendous perk and it's fun and exciting. (And ever-changing right now!) The different types of jobs you can have are equally as amazing. Administrative assistant, production line assembly, project manager, software tester, project manager, Scrum master, security guard, quality assurance (testing of the products or programs), sales rep....the list goes on and on. If you find you don't like what you do - stick it out for 2 years and transfer to something else. All of my supervisors- with the exception of 1 - have ALWAYS worked with me to get me to my next step at the company. This is the place to have inspiration and aspirations - and be safe in knowing your work is appreciated. They encourage you to volunteer. They encourage you to get up out of your cube to take a walk. They encourage you to seek a mentor to get you through your professional career. Everyone I have encountered is more than happy to sit down with you and discuss your professional life and give you advice. Cons:I'm a big believer that not all people can work at all companies. To work at 3M, you have to be flexible. Like - really flexible. And you have to work in ambiguous circumstances at times. If you're the type of person who always needs clear direction, probably not the best place for you. You have to NOT require constant supervision to get your job done. If you're in a leadership position, you have to have confidence in what you're doing and the ability to speak up and step out in a crowd when you have an opinion, yet know when to sit back and listen (and take some advice too!) You *will* have difficulties throughout your professional life - no matter what job you are in. From a manager who doesn't manage you the right way, to not being recognized on a project that you worked hard at, to arrogant people, etc. It's YOUR choice how you handle these things. Step up! Speak out! It's welcome at 3M - and with a bit of work (managing up!) - you can train your boss for what you need as well :) It's a big company - if you like small companies, this is not the place to work. You will more than likely have to walk over 100 feet to get to your desk. There are some that are still working in the ""old"" way - The ""good ol boys club"" - where you get promoted because you know them personally, etc. My advice - speak up when you feel shunned, do your part, and find another job in 2 years if it's not working out where you are. These are not deal breakers, but I can totally understand and appreciate difficulties through period of time. Advice to Management:Keep listening to us worker bees! Get rid of the remaining ""good ol boys club"" members. Keep standing up for what's right.",5,2019-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,25221199

So happy to be gone after 10+ years,Technical Manager in Singapore,"Pros:Because the company is so profitable (with unbelievably huge gross margins on every sale), the company is quite stable. Cons:- Over the years the organisational culture has become so toxic, with focus on hitting sales numbers the #1 driver above everything else. - There is zero care for customer experience or customer relationships. - All employees are seen as pawns to achieve the personal goals of career-minded managers. - Senior leaders generally don't care about individuals, but will only care as soon as they start to look bad. - Many positions at senior management level are like a rotating door, with huge amounts of churn. - Every person that has left is much happier afterwards... and many other people talk about leaving all the time but are too afraid to do so, because 3M also does a good job of convincing employees how wonderful they are compared to everywhere else. Advice to Management:The churn culture at 3M (i.e. senior leaders being replaced within 2-3 years) is toxic, demoralising and exhausting.",2,2019-03-18T00:00:00.000Z,25212249

Don't do it!,"Business Development Manager in Washington, DC","Pros:Great benefits, good pay, modern office environment, they either pay for metro OR garage parking, very established Cons:Avoid this place! 3M is a good company but management in the DC office doesn't understand what it takes to be a successful Business Development manager. They constantly micromanage you. You'll spend 75% of your day sitting in meetings, half of which are irrelevant to your BD portfolio. Every piece of work that you turn in will be scrutinized to the tenth degree. There is very little budget to go to conferences or meetings. If you are ""allowed"" to go, you've gotta provide a detailed explanation on why you need to go, an agenda, who you plan on talking with, a back brief etc. Management thinks that conferences, etc are a waste of time and money. They don't like you talking to other departments or senior Execs in the company without getting ""approval"" first. If you take a vacation, they'll make you feel guilty about it. Avoid this place at all cost. It sounds appealing and attractive but once you get there, you'll quickly realize it wasn't what you thought it would be. If you've worked in BD at other places, you'll think this place is a joke. Advice to Management:You hired strong competent people....let them to do their job.

You can do what you want at 3M with many opportunities for development, collaboration, and growth.

Salary, medical, and the 401k match are very competitive. 3M also offers a lot of development opportunities such as trainings, travel opportunities, and forums. Management is very flexible (usually) when it comes to working from home or alternative work schedules. You can really make your career your own and have many avenues and career paths to explore. Cons:Although most benefits are great, 3M is behind other companies in PTO. You have to work at 3M for 4 years to receive 3 weeks of vacations, before that you have 2 weeks and a handful of personal days. It seems like this is an inflexible, non-negotiable policy. 3M is still struggling with a stuffy, conservative culture as well. This culture is perpetuated by top level management. Advice to Management:Benefits should be competitive across the board to obtain and retain top level talent. There should also be a more concentrated effort to change the ""stuffy"" culture. This starts at the supervisor level and goes up the chain. Management should be trained to encourage diversity in thought and opinion, creativity, and transparency.

Outside Sales Representative,"Outside Sales Representative in San Jose, CA","Pros:Extreme amounts of flexibility. I talk to my manager once every other week and am able to completely make my schedule by myself, meaning I can have 5 home office days where I answer emails in my pjs, or I can be out in front of 10 different customers every day. You get to determine how to spend your time base on how you think it will grow your territory. Cons:In 2016 the outside sales team in the Industrial division went onto a ""nation pay plan"". We don't have accurate POS so we are paid on how the division is doing nationally...rather than how we are going our own territories. This means if you are exceeding quota or way below quota, you will still get paid the same as everyone else depending on how the division is doing nationally. Also, if you are in a sales roll, there is no upward movement for career growth unless you are willing to go to 3M's headquarters in St. Paul, MN. Advice to Management:Start paying sales reps based on their individual achievements stat!

"Peope are great, the HR structure is not inclusive to the diverse people","Customer Service Representative in Woodbury, MN","Pros:The people I work with directly run a great department and make you feel like part of the part department Once they see you can do more than just take direction, they let you take on more and more. They're extremely supportive within the areas they control. If you have a degree, you should be well off as long as you show you can do the job. If you don't have the degree, see below. Cons:The only downside is the incredible difficulty in trying to get hired on without a degree. In this one respect, 3M does not appear to be inclusive nor want to be diverse. Whether the contractor has worked for 3M for years or the contractor has helped save the company hundreds of thousands/millions, 3M HR standards block the contractor from being hired on. Even when managers go to HR and ask for exceptions, they're turned down most of the time. This interaction with HR highlights the discrepancy of the 3M messages of inclusiveness and wanting diversity and actual application of HR standards (which should include education level as ALL people can contribute equally. Not all jobs need a degree. Most of what you need to know about many of the jobs at 3M is actually learned on the job). Advice to Management:Be more inclusive and diverse in who you look at for your employee pool. Listen to your department managers and their requests. They know the people they're looking to hire. If they ask you (HR) for an exception to hire, it is because the person is worth hiring. They're not just wasting their breath because they want to argue with you (HR).",2,2018-11-26T00:00:00.000Z,23571686

Digital Marketer,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Flexibility, good amount of opportunities, good pay Cons:Coming from the perspective of a forward-thinking digital marketer, 3M is really behind on the benefits and value that marketing, let alone digital marketing, brings to a company. It holds antiquated ideas and gives most budget to R&amp;D and sales. It doesn't prioritize how to get products to market in the digital age, doesn't value reaching audiences where they are and focuses more on outdated brochures and sell sheets.

"Incredible Benefits, but....",Warehouse Associate,"Pros:I've been with 3M for 21 years, at times it's hard to believe it's been that long. The Benefits, especially Medical, have been awesome. Cons:I worked in a warehouse, in the beginning we were encouraged to want to advance. But as management changed, they made lead positions fixed and unless they left that position, there was never a chance to do more. They also didn't want ideas from the workers that did the same job everyday, they preferred to hire new engineers to do that. It was emphasized that a warehouse worker's thoughts were useless. The biggest Con, beware of being put on LTD. The facility i worked at, I could have worked in the office instead of permanent disability, but management for that facility preferred a separation of Office &amp; Warehouse. While it's great still getting medical benefits, the 60% pay of when you were put on LTD is rough. And there is no adjustment or pay increase if you are out for years. You will be quickly forgotten. As the Doctors have told me, it's the way of big business; they'd rather stick you in the system and forget than help you be beneficial to them. I truly love the company, the products are the absolute Best, but being forgotten on LTD is a road that leads to depression and self doubt. Advice to Management:People are your Biggest asset, just because they don't have a degree, doesn't mean they are all dumb. Was the Post-It Note purposely invented? Nope. I'm not saying all people can do something like that, but you'd be surprised how many have ideas that are told no thank you. And LTD, stop being like Big Business, care enough about your employees to Not Forget about these. These people are at home doing less than they want due to medical issues, but they can still exist on a computer, maybe they could still be a resource to help this company that they love. Stop saying we care and actually CARE!",4,2018-09-14T00:00:00.000Z,22478939

"Very good, could be better","Machine Operator in Cumberland, WI","Pros:Pay is competitive for the local area. I could make more elsewhere, but it's good for what we do. Benefits etc are at least as good (sometimes better) as other local opportunities. 3M club offers solid extracurricular activities, either company-sponsored or at an attractive discount Excellent coworkers. They screen out the jerks and mentally deficient. Paid time off policy is in line with what you'd get anywhere else, but they require only 24 hours notice if you want a day off. All your vacation is allowed up front. Cons:Usual ups and downs for factories. Right now we're in a slow period so no overtime or new hires. Temps are treated as temps. Pay scales make no sense and are not based on department rather than technical skill. Depending on what department you're assigned to at the beginning your starting pay could be mediocre (for mentally demanding work) or excellent (for easy work). Attendance policy is ultra-aggressive. If you're late, even 1 minute, 3 times in your first 6 months you're fired. With this company it's essential to have amazing transportation. No sick pay - you call in, you get a point. No ifs, ands, or buts. If you quit or get fired at some point during the year you have to pay back any vacation you've used but haven't ""earned"". Advice to Management:Take a closer look at pay scales across departments. If an advanced operator with excellent technical skills and 5+ years ijn their department is making the exact same wage as someone that literally just started (with no previous experience) in a different department, there's something wrong - especially when the latter operator is going to be making more than the advanced operator in 6 months.",4,2018-09-08T00:00:00.000Z,22381776

"Great Company, But IT needs to change",Anonymous Employee,"Pros:3M management is trying hard to reinvent and innovate. Management and HR are trying hard to retain IT talent and going through business transformation with new SAP implementation. People at 3M are nice and professional. It provides work and life balance. 3M is making a great effort in moving forward with new IT culture. Cons:Most people work at 3M IT full time do not have latest solid software development skills. That caused a lot of money being wasted. 3M relies on contracting firms ( most Indian firms) to deliver IT results. When things are not done on time, management has no clue as to why, because a lot of low level IT managers do not have any insights to evaluate, estimate and execute the project properly. Most IT managers do not have latest IT tech skills, instead, they have so called 'leadership skills"". If you are not a professional painter or have been a professional painter, it is harder for you to evaluate a professional painting job. How do you know that you get your money worth for such a job? Hardcore technical skills are not valued as much as soft 'Leadership"" skill. That resulted in a culture of promoting incompetent IT folks, these people then hire folks just like them, with no real hardcore software skills. It is a bad feedback loop. It wastes 3M's money. 3M has has an archaic HR structure, your manager is your key to success or failure at 3M. That does not fit in today's fast paced, democratic, meritocratic work culture. If your evaluation is deemed not satisfactory, your career at 3M is pretty much dead. That's why if you walk around 3M campus, you do not feel the vibrancy. 3M culture seems to promote niceness, niceness is great, but it does not help company's bottom line. Advice to Management:Promote IT employees with real hardcore skills to management positions, Create a culture which allows IT employee to move without current manager's approval. Because if you do not allow them to move within the company, they will move outside. That's a loss for 3M. Layoff all the talkers and keep the doers. Make 3M vibrant and great!",2,2018-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,22101719

Your Average Company,"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:They offer competitive pay and much better maternity leave than most companies in the US. Cons:Based off my own personal experience (may not be the same for others), they fully expect you to be available to answer questions/ask for assistance outside your working hours, even if you're paid hourly. I feel like they should provide much better computer software for every employee. For example, the system they use to enter/submit time is very out of date and not user friendly. The employee website is very disorganized, which makes it hard to find a lot of the information you're looking for. There isn't a specific point of contact for you to go to with any HR type questions, just a general number to call, which doesn't always provide you with reliable/accurate information. And their off-campus/leased buildings aren't the greatest quality for an office space. Considering how large of a company 3M is, you'd think they'd provide better options since they could easily afford it. Advice to Management:Assign a specific point of contact for all HR type questions.

Cons:More conservative when it comes to working remotely which impacts work/life balance - basically working from home is frowned upon by management. Does not offer ""summer hours"" for Friday afternoons during the summer (e.g. work extra hours during the week and get Friday afternoons off) Advice to Management:Continue to foster collaboration and learning different roles within the company.

3M Company Manufacturing Location,"Supply Chain Specialist in Des Moines, IA","Pros:Good reputation, some extra amenities if you work at the corporate headquarters. Cons:Many employees have a positive view of 3M if they work at the company headquarters. If you work at a manufacturing location you probably have a very different view. Many of the perks available at the headquarters are non existent at a plant location. Cost cutting measures generally impact the plant locations to a greater extent than corporate. 3M is quick to impose headcount and overtime restrictions at plants that cause significant pain for our customers when business is down across the company, even though it is still busy at the plant. The are also quick to require excessive overtime when busy. Plant managers are typically former engineers who have very little people skills and typically practice an authoritarian style of leadership. 3M has a very good overall reputation but there is a large disparity between working at the headquarters and working at a plant. 3M has a history of taking away benefits every year or increasing the cost of your benefits more than what the market is increasing. At manufacturing locations raises are typically very small and don't keep up with inflation. In many communities 3M plants have historically been the desired place to work but that is no longer the case. Opportunities for advancement only occur in manufacturing if you are willing to move every 2 to 3 years. Advice to Management:Treat employees at your manufacturing locations as well as you treat your employees at corporate headquarters. Provide more opportunities for advancement at manufacturing locations. Make decisions at plant locations based on the activity at the plant, not the company as a whole.",2,2018-08-09T00:00:00.000Z,21884945

pretty close to perfect,"TrainerDesigner in Brookings, SD","Pros:3M has been around for a long time and for good reason. It is a stable company and very interested in improving anywhere it can. It takes pride in how it is perceived by its customers and cares for its customers. It takes good care of it's employees while maintaining good business practices. I've worked for 3M for 33 years, 28 years was doing shifts on the production floor. Never seen a lay off in our division. Have had opportunity to advance and like the somewhat family atmosphere that I've been able to be part of. I have 401K opportunities, stock opportunities, great benefits, HSA opportunities, vacation that increases over service time. We are kept informed of upcoming plans, goals, policies etc. Cons:When we need cut backs I would like to see the belt tightened on Analyst spending with suppliers. I would like to see no speed increases on machines unless scrap is consistently down a certain percentage. I would like to see a better computer system implemented with the in-house IT support to back it up. I would love to see the on site warehousing reflect the true needs of the division it takes care of. It is completely inadequate and outdated. Advice to Management:Department Heads and Supervisors should be held to a high expectation and should be held accountable for their departments performance. They should be expected to ""Lead by Example"". The moral on a production floor reflects it's leadership above them. To promote caring and obligated production workers you must have caring and obligated supervision. Every once in a while production needs to see that upper management is not getting big bonuses when the working guy is not getting a very good raise. We're all in this together. Everyone is a gear in the working mechanism. Each gear needs to be taken care of so all the gears are affected positively.",4,2018-08-07T00:00:00.000Z,21845677

Management scrutinizes every single penny spent, and they still have the original lunchroom furniture, tables, and chairs from 44 years ago. Equipment is in need of repair, yet employees are forced to run equipment with broken sensors. Moral is terrible in manufacturing, all of the Staff treat the employees like bottom feeders, and it is Management by fear. Spend some money, provide recognition, show compassion for your workers. Working in manufacturing is brutal, it is all about putting out more material with less resources, and out of date equipment. Advice to Management:Straighten up your act, treat the employees with respect ,and dignity, quit being bully's to your employee's.

Best overall company to work for,"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:3M always tries to do the right things ... for empls, customers, communities, and of course, the stockholders.

In 35 yrs, I have lived &amp; worked for 3M in 7 different states (had 11 different job assignments during that time). The opptys are endless if you really apply yourself and produce good results, and want to try different roles. Cons:Being a big, publicly-traded company, there are controls (rules) designed to protect the interests of the owners (stockholders) and keep in compliance with the regulatory bodies. Also, there are times when the cost controls are hard to stomach ... but I have to remind myself that it's better to save a few bucks in the short term, than to let the finances fester and then mgmt has to take more drastic actions in the future.",5,2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,21835313

They pay a fair and reasonable salary for what you do and I am always amazed at how long people have stayed with the company. For such a large and global company as they are, 3M does their best to keep their employees happy and productive. I think they get it, that, it's easier and more efficient to try and keep an employee than it is to try and find new ones. Cons:It's a big company and that's not always the vibe some folks want to experience. Advice to Management:Consider trying another approach to software development than the scrum process. While it may produce some good results, the constant change it produces creates anxiety and upheaval for many.

Cons:As so many people work at 3M for their entire career, coming in mid-career from the outside is difficult - your previous experience is discounted. The salary is average. Advice to Management:A lot of effort is being put into recruiting talented mid-career people to fill 3M's bi-modal worker curve - make sure to nurture and retain them. Also, try to focus on hiring more quirky worker bees at entry level - the majority of new hires are very polished and are going to do great things - but aren't interested in doing work (maybe because there isn't incentive?)",4,2018-08-06T00:00:00.000Z,21825743

Now, it is run more like a corporation than a busness. Benchmarks on how many late orders can have due to not keeping raw materials on hand. And micro-managing by status boards that do not give a true picture of what is happening. Lean to production is less steps - Lean to management is nothing on the production floor - more steps to get what needs to be had. Advice to Management:Eliminate the department heads.

3M Health Care Business Group (HCBG),"Regulatory Affairs Manager in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:I love my job. 3M does a good job of growing and developing employees. The work environment is great. The leadership is inspirational and ethical. Management does a good job of being available and open to new ideas. I've been here about 10 years and I stay because I feel appreciated. And honestly, there are so many job opportunities within 3M I can try new things or completely new careers while still keeping my professional network and leveraging resources across platforms. The organization is highly matrixed and there is a lot of collaborative, cross-functional work. The teams are good and everyone pulls their weight Also, benefits are great. Pay is competitive. Being outside the city, the St. Paul campus is easy to reach, traffic is good and the parking is reasonable at the HCBG site. Cons:Some things are slow and deliberate. Getting people hired and getting projects funded can take longer than I would like, but they always get there in the end. 3M always runs lean. As a mid-level leader or manager, you should expect to also work as an individual contributor in some capacity. There is just never quite enough bandwidth on your teams. Advice to Management:Give greater expense approval budgets to your mid-level. Funneling every approval through high level management causes weeks of delay. You trust us to plan the budgets, run the projects, manage employees and contractors. We are responsible, accountable folks. Using corporate money wisely is a reflection of our personal brand.

3M Has Lost Its Way,"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Steady employment and decent benefits.

There is no room for entrepreneurs; bureaucrats run the show. Advice to Management:Pay less attention to what is going on within the four walls of 3M.

Okay Temporary Job,"Technical Aide in Maplewood, MN","Pros:-Not difficult to understand your job. Most tasks are trivial -32 hours a week is nice during the summer Cons:-Work culture is weird. Unnecessary drama and talking behind backs is common. It's high school for people with PhD's -No opportunities to go to meetings, interact with managers, or have a lot of interaction with other departments -Your experience is highly dependent on your boss(es) and building you work in. Many office spaces are depressing and many bosses are not a good fit for their interns. There are dozens of tech aide opportunities at 3M. Ask your future manager questions during your interview and make sure you want to commit to their projects. -The actual work you do is menial. Tech Aide input on experimental design is limited. You will inevitably run tests, prep samples, and do the dirty work for the majority of your time at 3M. The pain of your workload is 100% dependent on your manager. -3M hires tech aides because experimental tasks need to be completed. Instead of having Engineers run these tests, this work if off loaded to other employees if an engineer wants to more efficiently spend their time in meetings. Some choose to take this path, while others do their testing themselves. A lab technician would cost 3M too much money, so they choose high school and college students willing to work for poor wages. The pay is not really work the worth you have to do. Take a 3M tech aide job if you are a freshman/sophomore in need of a part time job and initial experience. If you can, work at another company that offers internships with strong pay and work load that will actually show you what being an engineer is all about",3,2018-06-22T00:00:00.000Z,21164283
Great peope. AIP is a joke.,"Software Engineer in Murray, UT","Pros:The people I work with are awesome. The project is interesting and the benefits are top notch. 401k is above and beyond. 5% match plus 3%. I contribute 5% and am getting 13% into my IRA. Also I think the vacation is just what it needs to be. It starts a little low but grows over the time you are there. The unlimited vacation that gets tossed around in the tech world now is a big trap. It just allows them to pile more work on you, even though it feels nice to think you have unlimited vacation, you end up getting less than if you had a fixed amount. Cons:AIP program is a joke. They hold a part of your salary and then in March they tell you that the division only hit 80% of it’s goal and then only give you 80% of what they held. Just call it a bonus guys and don’t try to tell me my salary includes that. Also the production staff is so far removed from sales that it makes it really difficult for us to feel like we have any sort of control over the performance of the division. Politics and red tape is a little out of hand. Security seems to exist to slow down development and cause them grief. Advice to Management:Restructure the AIP. Make incentives that work for the individual or teams. Trying to blanket the whole division with a plan doesn’t have the affect you want and ends up just making everyone feel like the company is robbing from them.",4,2018-06-21T00:00:00.000Z,21157146

3M Canada is a shadow of its former self.,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:In general, the people are great and the work is interesting and rewarding at 3M Canada. The salary and benefits are better than many other companies. Working from home or, if you can't work from home, taking 'personal time' is an option which is great for times when unexpected things pop up like a sick child or you need to be home to meet a plumber, etc. Work-Life balance is OK most of the time. Lots of volunteer opportunities. Amenities at HQ in London, ON: lounge areas, subsidised flat-rate catered lunches; fitness centre with showers; on-site fitness classes; ping pong table; on-site nurse. Cons:Overall, 3M is an ethical and somewhat transparent company but the management sometimes says one thing and does another, all the while pretending to take employees' opinions into consideration. In recent years, there have been more instances where a ""leader"" acts within their legal rights but the actions are not fair or ethical. It's unbecoming of the reputation that 3M has earned in the business world and with their employees previously. They are relying more and more on contract workers to fill gaps and save money without increasing head count or having to provide benefits. For several years of my tenure, contract workers had a reasonably good chance to get hired. In fact, I started as a contract worker and was hired in just over a year. Now, the time you can be on contract is limited and *very few* get hired on as permanent employees. Really good people that you rely on daily can be gone and replaced with a 'newby' at any time and you have to spend precious time training someone else to do what the previous person was very capable of doing. Employee morale is usually high but the recent changes in the C-suite and the decisions that they've been making over the last 2 years have betrayed the trust and dampened the spirit of a lot of people. Many great people have either left or been let go without true cause. Advice to Management:3M Canada used to be a place where opportunities were abundant and most employees really enjoyed going to work every day, myself included. The work wasn't easy but that's part of what made it a great place to work. The current atmosphere is stressful and riddled with uncertainty. Please start promoting ""leaders"" again, not ""bosses."" Bosses ""do things the right way"" -- their way or the highway -- and they can keep a business afloat in the short term. However, leaders ""do the right thing,"" by empowering, developing and trusting good people which ensures long-term business success...in other words, practice what you preach. Personality conflicts should not be considered ""cause"" to fire an employee with an (otherwise) good to excellent performance history. Find them a better 'fit' elsewhere in the company. Please don't pretend to ask for the employees' opinions when a decision has already been made at the corporate level. Just do it. That will cause much less resentment. Train all of your employees (especially young managers) on combating ageism which is becoming much more prevalent with the influx of younger workers. Older workers have a lot to offer and they deserve to feel appreciated and empowered like any other employee. No one should ask them out of the blue, ""So when are you retiring?"" in their first meeting with a new group or supervisor! Ultimately, I'm happy to not be employed at 3M Canada any longer. However, I am also very disappointed and sad that the 3M I loved working for no longer exists. It is simply a shadow of its former self.",3,2018-06-04T00:00:00.000Z,20879212

Cons:This place has horrible management, and truly couldn’t care less about their employees. If you’re lucky you might get a 1-2% raise no matter what your numbers for the year. The management is more knowledgeable on the “procedures and policy” than they are of the actual job. Writing people up and wasting their employees time for things that could be talked about and moved on from. They sure know how to micromanage people that have been doing the job for years, while talking to them like they’re idiots. Value? They don’t value their employees at all. It doesn’t matter if you consistently meet goals you’re lucky to get an “attaboy.” The management follows rules and enforced rules as it’s convenient to them. It’s a negative work environment, the pay isn’t all that great and there’s really no room for improvement. If you’re not a favorite you don’t get to work overtime.

Stay away,"Sales in Phoenix, AZ","Pros:Very nice insurance benefits, car, phone, etc. for field-based employees, decent compensation Cons:Seriously over-priced products make it difficult to win against many competitors who love taking business away from 3M; frequently had to do price deviations to gain business; far too many non-revenue producing ""managers"" that looooove to come to this warmer climate during the long Minnesota winters under the premise of ""I want to work with you"" (meaning they will make 2-3 sales calls, then get dropped off at a golf course to meet a friend or relative, and you won't hear from again ... until next year). For years, 3M billed itself as being ""innovative"", but they really are not innovative anymore and haven't been for many years. They don't really develop new products any more, they just find new ways to spin their old products and sell them into different markets. And they just buy up their competition and take over their management with 3M zombies. 3M also likes to tell new hires that they can expect to be employed with 3M for their entire career ... and then lay people off when the economy starts to go through the down cycle ... only to replace them a few months later with someone 20 years younger with no work ethic, no knowledge of the workplace.

32 YEAR,"Crew Leader in Tonawanda, NY","Pros:I worked 32 years in one plant, so my employment was solid. I made over 90k a year in the last three years I worked for them, but you had to be willing to work overtime to make it. I was a union employee. My base pay was 60k my co-worker from the first shift made over 125k in the last three years so you could imagine how much o.t. he worked. we had mandatory o.t. in some parts of the plant, but most of it was volunteer. Cons:In my 32 years about 7 of it was hell for me and most of us do to very unforgiving management. But after the plant did a plant wide survey, union and non union, 240 surveys were handed in and ""ALL"" surveys were VERY negative, 3M st Paul was shocked by the survey and the work got back to us that it was the worst survey they ever received. But! I give them credit 3M(st paul) within one year all five plant leadership team were gone, two fired three other moved to other plants. I also give credit to the worker's both union and nonunion for standing up to them, that is what got me in trouble,I was always a few years ahead in my opinion of management and they did not like it. So i paid for that when we had the bad managers. When I left 5 months ago the management was ok, no bad eggs. There are not many cons because when you get hired you know what your in for has far as over time and other things that bother some employee's. BUT THE ONE CON I CAN'T LEAVE OUT, IS THERE IS NO PENSION, THEY STOPPED IT TEN YEARS AGO. THEY DO HAVE 401K AND A LITTLE EXTRA MATCH ON SAVINGS FOR new hires. So if you could find a job with a pension and a 401k and same pay,go for it. 3M doesn't make any promises when it comes to money. Advice to Management:Treat your employees with respect, it is the only way you will be respected, Come down from the ivory tower and talk to your employee's, we like to know what is going on. Worker's like to know who their breaking their backs for! If you don't it will cost you.",4,2018-01-06T00:00:00.000Z,18612100
Where careers become stagnant,"Anonymous Employee in Maplewood, MN","Pros:An org that is full of potential and opportunity. Strong brand equity and solid reputation. Educated and in some cases distinguished knowledge workers: corporate scientists, chemists, high profile executives. Long history and vast array of products. Solid compensation and benefits package. Cons:Toxic organizational culture. Authority and order driven culture. Dated approach to diversity and inclusion. Immensely unhappy workforce. Complacent and apathetic tenured employees. Elitist and power hungry executive attitudes. Change and risk averse environment. Incredibly hierarchical, bureaucratic and formal. Stifling for creativity and innovation. Embarrassingly frequent misuse and waste of resources. Highly unethical and deceptive. Unable to retain millennial talent. Poor talent development opportunities at every level of the company. Pathologically political environment. Opportunistic and self-absorbed middle management. Overly siloed down to project teams within teams. Cronyism, nepotism, and favoritism. Fumbling, inconsistent approach to strategic planning. Best practice developed through confirmation bias. Many highly educated but poorly seasoned/experienced employees. Check-the-box, stale approach to work. Terrible communications company-wide. Advice to Management:Clean house of poor leadership. Hire consultants to help redefine and effectively spread, promote and indoctrinate employees to organizational culture. Create and employee-centric environment. Centralize, empower and properly invest in the communications team. Institute 360 degree feedback reviews. Stop outsourcing the creative- and strategy building processes – employees should be closely involved with/responsible for shaping new ideas to develop a sense of ownership. Cultivate and celebrate internal thought leadership. Flatten organizational structures within departments/businesses and empower employees to be leaders at every level. Update your buildings. Allow more flexibility to work remotely especially on frigid cold winter days, which requires trusting your employees. Fix your onboarding process – it’s boring and uninspiring and there is so much potential for the complete opposite.",1,2018-01-05T00:00:00.000Z,18594268

Overall HIS is a GREAT place to be; but beware of AIP & ask for 3 weeks vacation to start,"Analyst in Albany, NY","Pros:Amazing work-life balance; WFH/remote option; generally extremely intelligent co-workers; excellent workplace atmosphere; wonderful health benefits; great vacation; reduced stock purchase plan is fantastic; 401k is 5%-income match. Cons:Very very poor middle management; performance reviews are a joke (sadly) and there is a forced distribution such that everyone essentially gets a 3 (on a scale from 1 to 5); nearly impossible to get rid of people who are worthless (they end up quitting or stay forever). Advice to Management:Titles mean very little; degrees mean essentially nothing; cut the fat and promote career development by having performance plans that mean something (right now they are arbitrary in a forced distribution and everyone gets a 2% increase, nothing is merit based). There are also many positions that just dead end and have no further career path. Middle managers (e.g., anyone with ``supervisor'', ``manager'', or ``director'' in his/her title) should be evaluated for ability; many are incompetent and this is completely inconsistent with those that they manage and that manage them; this layer of the company needs to be seriously reviewed. The sales team is positively miserable and some people that are in sales (e.g., Engagement Leads), are not even commission based but pull well into 6-figures with no ding to salary when they consistently fail to meet expectations.

Energizing Job Potential -- But Need to Recognize & Promote Real Leadership & Creative Talent,Anonymous Employee in Saint-Paul,"Pros:Diverse workforce working in diverse business segments. Caliber of new employee hires is above average... great place to learn, get experience to list on resume (great brand recognition), and leap forward in your career pathway (with or without 3M). Cons:Rarely hires seasoned experienced managers / leaders. Prefers to groom recent low $ graduates into molded minions. Unfortunately they haven't invented a 'Post-it' type game changer product line in 30+ years... the post millennium era culture / 6 Sigma playbook being run prevents true innovative ideas from incubating and becoming a unique solutions to 'customer unarticulated needs'. Career ops depend heavily on where one is located and willingness to relocate. Advice to Management:Sweep out / retire some of the old guard serving as risk averse 'shopkeepers', and bring on some talent from other innovative disciplines and industry segments.

‘Minnesota Nice’ describes it well,"Supply Chain Analyst in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Great health/stock benefits, on site health center, usually can get free /discounted products.

Office environment was grimy, dirty and disgusting, appeared as if it hadn’t seen a refresh since the 70s. Technology was a joke, phone system incredibly outdated, my old school tube computer monitor (not flatscreen) had scratches all over the screen to where I could only use the top 1/3, my keyboard was missing keys- management refused to upgrade either because ‘I had a laptop’. Education reimbursement policy was department by department & they refused to pay anything towards my MBA. (Even though verbal promises had been issued) Also would not let you transfer within the company unless you found someone willing to ‘switch’ with you. I was harassed and threatened daily for 2 years by an employee nearing retirement age - this employee was an extreme under performer and would frequently blame failures on me, (we weren’t even in the same department) but management refused to address due to political & age discrimination fears.

Lots to be happy about but too much red tape,"Marketing Manager in London, England","Pros:The only reason why I stay at 3M is because of the recharge time we get. You can choose your hours between 10-3pm - which is helpful for mums. Plus if you work ridiculous hours like me, this equates to an extra 12 days per year (however- I work around 45-50 hours a week on average)- so you could argue whether this is a real benefit or willing exploitation ?! You don't get overtime. You are given autonomy- you are left to get on with things and micromanagement is something that no one has time for! Cons:Expectation that you will work at 120% all the time (what I mean by this is working at your fullest between 9-5 is never good enough) There are times you'll be expected to stay overnight working, or work until 1/2am, and this is deemed normal... dont expect anyone to be sympathetic that you missed your kids first dance. Recent pay gap survey showed that there is a 14% difference in pay between women and men . 3M said this was good enough and progressive. I can only speak for my own career but I have found that people who are 'yes' men/women get further. I'm sure this would be something denied, but ive been with 3M over 15 years now! As soon as you get to a certain level... there are only middle aged men in 3M. They've all been in their positions for 30+ years. Advice to Management:Can you honestly say there is a real Succession plan? Pay is poor - yes really!!! Are you actually loooking at hours of employees?

Pay may be good but quite frankly over the years other local companies have caught up. Its easier to take a point than ask your doctor to fill out and correspond with Sedgewick, my primary care giver told me to find a new one because of it.

Welcome to Corporate Marketing - 1990s style,"Corporate Marketing in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:If you don't have any relevant background particularly in digital, don't worry. 3M doesn't have the management with an adequate understanding of the requisite skill set to be able to tell. Cons:Incompetent management at all levels within corporate marketing. New leadership in April announced that 3M is now a ""digital company"" in the same way that Google is a digital company without any change to organizational structure or staffing. The entire digital ""strategy"" can be summed up by endless repetition by management of the words ""agile,"" ""SEO,"" and ""governance."" There is no understanding of what those words mean or how they would be relevant for a large manufacturing company with a massive unnavigable catalog-based website. Even within 3M, the website is viewed as a joke and instead of hiring digital professionals to fix it, boomer-aged engineers are shifted sideways into leadership roles where they (unsuccessfully) guess at how the internet works and refuse to listen to anyone that tells them otherwise. Any attempts at education are a waste of breath as the entire entire corporate structure is dead weight that know they won't be fired as there is zero accountability. Anyone who has been around for more than 2 years has given up even attempting to accomplish anything useful and only compound the problem. - Don't even get me started on how employees are forced to wash their dishes in the bathroom.

Like most companies you are expected to own your own development but they will be supportive in you getting involved in projects across a variety of divisions and functions as long as you continue to deliver in your role.

Don't work as a contract employee with the hope you will get hired on full time!,"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Good group of people to work with (very smart, personable, etc.) Cons:They hire many highly educated people as contract employees to keep the ""head count"" down. I have been here for 2 years and have seen many contract employees and not one get hired on full time. The new contract employees get trained in by the ones with the contract about to expire. These are people with engineering degrees from accredited universities. Also, if you are a contract employee, you don't get to go to team meetings or team outings, no health insurance, no benefits, and the list goes on. I would advise against working under contract unless you are desperate for a position. Advice to Management:Instead of having 10 contract employees, hire a couple more full-time positions.

The company protects itself over protecting its employees, and if a division is ""Not Profitable"", of which 3M has a very distinct definition, there is a possibility of your position, or even the division you are working in, to be eliminated. They do have generous severance package, but it is no fun being unemployed. Not for the faint of heart! Advice to Management:Employees are your greatest resource. Managers often live in ""castles"" and are not in touch with their employees. A 360 review process could humble some managers who think they are above everyone else. As well, understanding that employees are not numbers on a spreadsheet, but real life people, with feelings and needs.

Cons:No accountability (which is great when you're not good because it is pretty rare 3M will fire someone). Even though 3M likes to believe they are innovative, the real innovations often come from acquisition. ""Red tape"" is heavy. Because of the culture of 0-risk, decisions are often not taken bu low management because of their lack of experiences which slow down by far introduction of new products.

As all technical fields, still a very old and male-dominated workforce though as a general rule, people are very welcoming (maybe Minnesota Nice comes into play here). Advice to Management:Keep listening to your employees new ideas (esp. new employees not yet jaded by 20+ years of 3M/industry experience).

These employees are doing the same job as the 3M'ers at a lower salary and no benefits. Your decision not to renew contracts is causing you to lose talented employees. 3M needs to show loyality to their country and not eliminate American jobs by outsourcing them to Costa Rico. Shame on you! 3M also needs to stop overworking their employees and recognize when they have unreasonable expectations, workloads are not attainable and recognizing when more employees are necessary.

Cons:Management is ""Superior"" to all, as in they are holier than art thou. Hated working under the plant manager who was present during my employment in 2012-2015 and HR went to crap. They will walk you out of the plant/fire you over the dumbest things (even for so much as uttering a curse word), they've taken away profit sharing, forced 401K of 6% or you can't have it, and it felt like they quit fighting for decent priced insurance. Also, no pension. You put into your 401K or nothing when you retire. 3M has scaled way back on bonuses offered to employees and hires/shuffles around horrible management. You can almost guarantee whoever your supervisor is has no clue what the actual job is of those they are supervising, as in they've never done the job so you could lie and say something takes you twice the time to screw around or you could say it takes half the time and do a really crappy job. If you don't do your work, management will more than likely just force one of your co-workers to do it (one of the grunt workers) because none of them have a spine to speak to those who defy them. You must also have a certain last name to gain any recognition to move up. If your nose isn't brown, you can stay the low man on the totem pole. Also HR isn't there for employees; they're there for ""the company"" so they do no wrong because it's the ""employees"". Advice to Management:Hire better management including more effective HR, enforce fair practices, stop showing favoritism, and make group leaders more accountable. Also, give the employees back their pensions, stop the forced 6% of the 401K (let them put it 3% if they want), and for God's sake, let them smoke.

Quality Control Associate,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Nothing. It is all bad. Cons:Parsimonious. Expensive health care. They have a program called PRIDE. When a worker did an exceptionally good job, his/her would hand out a PRIDE ticket which has a money value of $5 per ticket. The worker then use the PRIDE ticket to exchange for an 3M item(s) on 3M Employee Store. Or, he/she can use 2 of the PRIDE tickets ( worth $10) to exchange for 2 SMALL PIECES of pizza. If one prefers the first type of exchange (to get the 3M's item/items), good luck. He/she would lose the PRIDE tickets for goods because the HR takes the tickets and never ordered the item for that employee. 3M lays off most jobs that are high paid. Whoever still left to work with them see their job duty triple as he/she has to do his/her job plus those jobs of those who were laid off. The worst thing about 3M is their health care is very expensive. Their employees see their out-of-pocket cost jumps through the roof every year.",2,2016-09-23T00:00:00.000Z,12050558

Working For 3M,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Salaries are competitive and benefits are good. 3 weeks vacation to start and personal days. Good medical, eye, and dental. Long term and short term disability. Life insurance. However, the 401K company contribution was deceased from 6% to 5% while they eliminated the pension program. They continue to put more financial responsibility on employees to pay benefits. Cons:Company culture is bad. If you are not part of the good old boy network then forget it. Company laid off 2000 employees at the end of 2015 while the CEO made $20 million in salary and millions in stock options. Also the company spent over $6 billion in 2015 on stock buybacks to prop their stocks up while not giving out raises. Employees are pawns plus the company has to many chiefs and not enough Indians. To many managers, directors, and executives. Leaders stay and producers are let go. One thing that disturbed me about 3M is the lack of organization and commitment to projects, customers, and products. Most investment was in stocks and not enough in the business model. Many customers were frustrated and complained due to the lack of business professionalism. Advice to Management:Hire managers that are qualified to do the job. To much politics in hiring because of the good old boy network. Improve on customer service an helping the customers.

Overall the people have been excellent and leadership has been good. I hope to work here as long as they will let me. My management has been very supportive of my advancement and has worked to help me move up. Great pay, competitive benefits. Cons:Over the past ten years the company seems to have gotten more bureaucratic with more and more mandated corporate programs. Frankly these have not added much value. Also the blessing of having many long term employees is also a curse. Many are complacent and become negative about how bad they have it when in reality they have it better than 99% of the population out there. My only worry is that over the past few years company growth has been a challenge. We have been able to cost control our way to meeting earnings expectations but that next big thing has. It been visible and I am worried that eventually investors will lose their patience and force management to do dumb things. Advice to Management:If you are going to try to implement lean manufacturing don't try to be so formulaic. Also, try to implant it in business and upper management processes as well.

Contractors are treated as second class citizens,"Marketing in Maplewood, MN","Pros:It's an iconic MN company A major MN employer **Despite popular belief, 3M was NOT recently named the best place to work. Instead, it was named ""most desirable place to work"" by a bunch of high school students -- and the reason for this is still beyond me. 3M must have a very good PR team that put lots of $$ towards getting these results. This company is NOT sexier than Google or Apple or even Target.** Cons:Don't expect to be treated as an equal if you're working here as a contractor. Don't expect to have an email address, laptop or any basic office supplies during your first week. You'll have to wear a yellow badge of shame that doesn't even get you access to the convenience store to buy a pack of gum. Don't expect to be invited to meetings, included on email distribution lists or given any ""real work"" whatsoever. Expect to be an order taker or a PowerPoint monkey. Expect to be fully disposable and interchangeable. The interns are treated with much more respect and are given higher quality assignments than the contractors. Yes, you read that right: at 3M, there's a level below intern and it is reserved for contract employees. Oh and there's also a 12-month rule for contractors that nobody is going to tell you about (as a contractor, you can only work for 12 months and the you have to leave for 6 months before continuing to do contract work at 3M). Your hiring manager and staffing agency aren't going to let you know about this - despite the fact that this is a pretty critical detail that most people would like to be aware of before accepting a job. The culture at 3M is very traditional/formal/old school and there's a lot of competitiveness and secrecy within teams rather than collaboration and open communication. It's every man for himself! And prepare to be stepped on if you're a contractor. Advice to Management:There's been a lot of positive PR recently about working at 3M. Maybe it's time to start walking the walk and actually making it a better place to work....?",1,2016-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,11955925

Technically orientated company with great manufacturing capabilities. Focused on people development Cons:Process orientation can get in the way of speed and progress.

"hardware anagement good, software bad","Senior Software Engineer in Austin, TX","Pros:Good company to work for. Good benefits. Cons:The company seems to buy up other small companies to expand business. When they buy a company that is involved with software, be careful. 3M does not have a clue how to manage software. Paint, materials, physical machines, consumer products - all yes. But software, they don't know what they are doing. They will buy a company with a software product. Say they will let them use agile processes, but then the MANY layers of management are all the traditional waterfall method. After buying the company, spending a lot of money on the software development, they lay off all the people and throw away the software product. I've seen this happen twice.

Stodgy & Stuffy,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:good benefits, nice people, good at the science stuff Cons:3M purchased our dmv software company several years ago and smugly said, ""3M knows how to handle acquisitions."" Except for this one apparently. After running it into the ground, they sold off the remaining semi-viable pieces and ran for the hills. In their wake, they left several small business distributors and suppliers without any apologies. This is for the Austin site, but most still applies to 3M as a whole. They are conservative, as in, ""1970s mindset is good enough for us, why change?"". Honestly, the only forward-thinking they do is wondering if shareholders will get a dividend next quarter. HR and management have company interest first and ONLY. I was not given an exit interview, and when I asked I got no response. No one cared that numerous people left due to toxic environment. Some manager's rule by fear and seemingly enjoy it. Advice to Management:I won't give any advice, because you won't listen anyway.

They want you to do the same job for years and not ask for more. This is creating an unhappy work environment and people demotivate each other. If you are not in HR s favourite list in the first two years it means you lost your chance to become sth forever. Advice to Management:Dont be afraid of people asking for opportunities.

A Contractor's Review,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:This is a company working hard to move to a more progressive position in its industries, and brings an incredibly strong history of innovation into its future. They appear to work hard to find positions for their employees when layoffs or reorgs occur, and there are still a lot of people at 3M who've been here for decades, which I find amazing and also to their credit. Once you're in, you're taken care of. Also, for the most part, when I said I needed something - equipment, hardware, software - It been provided. They seem to get people what they need to do their job well, in this regard. Cons:Until recently, 3M had many employees who had been working as contractors for many years. They've changed their policy around term limits, and many of my peers have been moved into direct-hire positions, which, to me shows a recognition of the talent they have in their ranks, so that's a bit of pro... They've been slow, in my opinion, to modernize their online resources and digital toolsets for employees, but this too seems to be getting a lot of support, now. I don't really see many cons without caveats. Advice to Management:Keep nurturing your people. It's noticed. And really focus on doing whatever you can to get your teams' knowledge captured and easy to find by the community.

Cons:Pushes united way too much. Legacy and good ol boy system. Team leadership often micro manages. Advice to Management:Stop micro managing. Lead operators should be held more accountable.

You can tell them a problem and the solution and they won't do anything. Pretty lazy. Management is always right, won't open their eyes to see things any other way. This is a very racist environment, blacks people are treated horribly. (I'm white) In my entire life this is hands down the worst job I have ever held, I can't wait to move on and hope I don't smash my head into a wall before I do. This job is nothing but frustration.

The benefits are competitive, with high 401K match, reasonable health, and opportunities to move up and around in the company. Depending on the position and manager, it can be a very flexible place to work. Cons:Once you start, there is little negotiations over salary within a role. You do have to be willing to move in order to get the good pay bump. Also, the variable pay will depend on the division and/or plant results, but that is typical for other companies as well. Advice to Management:Be willing to re-evaluate pay within a role, and give an actual bonus (surprise and unexpected pay) if someone is doing a great job (in other words those that are artificially kept at a 'Meets Expectations' level).

Performance exceeding expectations not sufficient to save long career in R&D,"Advanced Research Specialist in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:- The worker bees in R&D are wonderful - Work-life balance is average - Not much travel required for most R&D positions (could also consider this a con) Cons:- Ageism practiced regularly. Culture of fear for employees older than about 45 and on pension plan 1. Productivity is terrible. The company does a good job of hiding it. In my former lab, 69% of all employees job-eliminated were 50 or older. It is justified by fitting the demographics of the lab but not the corporation. Targeting an area staffed heavily with older employees amounts to ageism by default. - Estimates are that about 50% of all current employees will experience at least one job elimination during their tenure - Job eliminations by project and not performance; history of excellent performance does not help - Pay was about 12% less than industry average for my field - 3M underpays colludes with peer companies to set salary levels. This is legal because they do it using grouped data through a consulting firm and not company-to-company. 3M underpays relative to the center of the distribution for its peer companies - Millennials in certain disciplines leave after 3-5 years due to low pay and scant promotions - At risk pay is forced on employees who have no business or R&D strategy or program selection decision-making power. At risk pay is included as a percentage of their base salary and not as a bonus - Incompetent managers placed by Jim McNerney are entrenched at senior levels. McNerney may have failed to destroy the culture of innovation at 3M, but his legacy is carrying it out effectively - R&D and product development is being managed by executives, including the CEO, who have no clue how they work - CEO wants to measure the return on investment in R&D. The answer is easy. EVERY product 3M makes and sells came from R&D either internally or by acquisition. - Promotions depend highly on your management and business unit success. - Management is promoted based on ""potential"" and technical workers are promoted based on results. Advice to Management:- Stop managing staff by job eliminations. If you must cut staff, do so by performance and not project - Eliminate pay at risk for all non-executives - Pay above the mean and median for your peer companies - If you want to consider digitization then you have to pay like companies outside your peer group - Compared with high tech companies 3M is not spending much on R&D at all. Large software companies may spend as more than 25% of its sales on R&D. Example: Autodesk.",1,2016-07-01T00:00:00.000Z,11107926

Networking and learning from other departments is encouraged and scheduled. Co-workers are courteous to each other during 95% of the disagreements, which is way more than other companies. Excellent pay and benefits. Cons:Sometimes there are unrealistic expectations for financial performance and project schedules. That can lead to difficult conversations to explain what is realistic, project flops, or rush-job mistakes. When we're short-handed, we have engineers with 25 years of experience doing entry-level technician work. It's not efficient. Advice to Management:Overall great job. I learn a lot from upper and middle management. Try to understand what is realistic. We'll buy in and work extra hard when you're knowledgeable. If you keep changing directors or managers of a poor performing department, it won't necessarily solve the problems. Attack the problems with another method or ask an internal consultant to help.

One organization you do not have to wonder are they going to be around next week. Very stable. The leadership knows what to do as far as moving the company forward. Cons:The only complaint is the lack of training. When you hire new staff you have to have a training program for your new people directly tied to the programs they will be using. Training is provided towards 3M as a whole but not towards your specific product. Advice to Management:Develop very specific training programs and spend the money training new staff. Not training new people and continuing to training is like buying a car and trying to drive it on three tires.

Don't know the business and make decisions without knowledge. They don't care about employees or their welfare. *Too many useless meetings causing reduction in productivity. *Down-sizing and job eliminations every quarter has caused employee fear, hurting productivity, especially in the over 50 age group.

This company is an old boys club across the board. Management, is old aged and clueless in my area. Performance on 2-3 full time equivalent projects are demanded with ridiculous timelines (1/10th time of industry). Some groups (mine) are still trying to hire one person to work one position for their whole life. Organization as a whole is cutthroat, if you're a real jerk to everyone and good at pawning off your work on others and taking the credit, backstabbing every now and again, you may get somewhere. I've personally been blocked internally by my manager from applying to new jobs (puts in the bad word during hiring process) just so that he can keep me in his department. Couldn't be more unhappy.

I cannot believe that 3M put me on the street in my 50s. Cons:It is not the same 3M that I knew. There has been a complete change in attitude toward employee retention. If you are 45, your days are numbered and look for a ""fresh out"" to replace you with a slightly different job description. May the same thing happen to top leaders of 3M. Yes, I am disgruntled.

Multi-departmental exposure for higher level positions. Current CEO are long term 3Mers Cons:Culture shift, including significant reliance on outside resourses at corporate. Has reduced opportunities for growth and advancement. Culture and short term focus also now lead to advancement of individuals taking action based on individual professional goals rather than the cooperation and leadership that promotes true health of the organization. The degree of management comprised of such individuals, their continued promotion, has led to loss of high performers, long term 3Mers, and most importantly, increased cost and risk for the company. Trend toward utilization of increased workdays resulting from burnout. Direct managers tend to do the work of their direct reports rather than delegate. Minimal communication by managers with direct reports. The blaming mentality of the 3M culture in addition to continual layoff has created a fear based environment.

Touch Systems - good and bad,"Senior Hardware Design Engineer in Methuen, MA","Pros:Touch Systems has many bright people and products that represent the high-end of a market that is increasingly becoming a commodity. They are committed to quality and high performance. 3M as a company does a better job with employee training and technical education than any other place I've worked. If you are willing to relocate there are many opportunities to advance within the organization at other 3M divisions Cons:Touch screens don't necessarily fit 3M's business model. They are costly to produce and demand for the high-end systems 3M makes may not be great enough to sustain the business. Although 3M does their best to keep a culture of innovation, they are a big manufacturing company and have lots of policies and procedures that promote caution, deliberation and avoiding mistakes at all costs. 3M likes to rotate its managers into different business groups. As a result upper management at Touch Systems changed every couple years. Each new manager would need to be educated in the realities of the business. Frequently the new manager would have a grand (and unrealistic) vision for the business that he would try to implement. This led to many false starts. 3M sets its salaries on the high end of average for similar large manufacturing companies. This probably worked out well for chemists in the mid-west but electronics and software engineers in the Boston area received less than they would have at a local tech company",3,2016-05-26T00:00:00.000Z,10736164

Non-stop meetings, little results and lots of circular conversation. It takes forever to get even the smallest things approved, and original thinking is best kept to your self. Layoffs galore last year. Fear based workplace. Advice to Management:Top executives are never seen and have a special floor they rarely leave. All receive millions annually but at best ""interact"" with the little people, their own employees, through video messages or email announcements.

Business Director,"Divisional Vice President in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Good brand and reputation. High accountability and metrics driven, Cons:Unfriendly to women in business. Little leadership development. Not conducive to growth and development - unless you're in the good old boy network. The good old boy network is exceptionally prevalent at 3M. Heavy backstabbing, passive aggression and blaming culture. No work/life balance. Advice to Management:Keep people in positions long enough to see the results of the strategy - broadening people through moves every 12-18 months is too frequent. Figure out how to develop and promote women. Work on building a strong, positive culture instead of the undercurrents of divisiveness in the good ole boy network that are allowed to run the company.",1,2016-05-18T00:00:00.000Z,10646956

The day the VP came in to tell us we were all losing our jobs to outsourcing she really could have cared less. Very impersonal way to tell 120+ people they are losing there jobs. If you do decide to work for 3M your better off going to corporate to work. Advice to Management:The site manager has been the best I've ever seen.

technical women,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:The salary is competitive, and there is a an effort to instill flexibility into your daily schedule. Cons:Benefits in general are above average, but not sure I can say many positive things if you are thinking about starting a family. Advice to Management:Health benefits should track with job grade, not just time served at the company. Those of us hired in at the T3 level needed 10+ years of training outside the company to be qualified to do the work you need us to do, yet our benefits do not track accordingly. If you actually want to be supportive of hiring women in STEM fields, then face the fact that we are in our 30s and want to start a family. (In the current system, female employees have minimal maternity leave and male employees have only 2 days paternity and only 2 weeks vacation that they can use when they start, regardless of the grade. I tried to negotiate for more when I was offered the job and was extremely unsuccessful.) Hire more support staff for your T3 and above workers. Male and female alike, we spent a long time in graduate school learning how to think and plan experiments.

They do as little possible and documentation trail is really poor. Management culture takes recognition from people rather than recognizing direct reports. No empowerment to work harder. Just keep doing the same thing over and over. They definitely enable each other's poor performance and do not recognize individual performers. Employees give typical excuses of that's the way it's always been done so the culture is resistant to changes or improvements. Systems are old and archaic and difficult to navigate. Training is poor and insufficient. Advice to Management:Listen to your employees. Do 360 reviews of managers to assure their performance is fairly evaluated.

Production Operator,"Production Operator in Quapaw, OK","Pros:3M plants are usually the best paying jobs in their area, which is how they keep employees in spite of all the abuse. Cons:Prior to 3M ownership, our plant had straight shifts, sick time, bonuses for perfect attendance, and very little mandatory overtime. Now we work rotating 12 hour shifts that make family life difficult, employees are forced to use vacation time when sick (3M will deny this but the system is so rigged that it is vitually impossible to call in sick without accruing disciplinary points - your doctor has to fill out a mountain of paperwork verifying that you could not perform your job duties and if submitted in time, is hardly ever approved), time in and time out has no flexibility making communication difficult and staff was cut, overtime is not only built into the schedule but demanded regularly as well as working holidays, and you must also burn up vacation to take off on a holiday. 3M claims to have a week of ""Other Paid Absences"" which looks good in theory but again employees are given disciplinary points so it's a dangling carrot. Nearly weekly reminders that you must make another sacrifice for ""The Big 3M"". Opportunity for promotions is laid out in theory, but impossible to achieve - the ""certification tests"" for promotion do not exist. In summary, 3M is a good place to make money but throw away your life, family, and self-dignity. Advice to Management:Respect for and a meaningful shift differential for those working twelves and overnight shifts. Stop forcing employees to use vacation time for sick days or holidays. Stop tellling employees that they are lucky to have more days off by working twelves (we give up more actual hours of our life). Stop pretending you're the greatest place to work because you pay well. Tell Sedgwick to simplify the paperwork doctors must fill out to verify you are sick, and then actually approve it.",2,2016-04-28T00:00:00.000Z,10426729

Time off is actually time off, and when you leave work for the day (everyone leaves at 4 or 4:30) you're done. Cons:I've never experienced such apathy and incompetence in a workplace. No one is motivated to learn how to use any new technology because they are literally just waiting to retire (the average age of employees is about 60). In the digital field, new young people leave because they are floored by how behind 3M is in all things digital. If you actually care about developing your career for the long haul, stay away from this place. You won't develop professionally at 3M, you will spend all your time trying to get the company into the 21st century against all odds and a workforce that doesn't know (and doesn't care) how the internet works. Advice to Management:The culture really needs to be addressed. You can see people come to 3M with energy and ideas. However, they get told ""No"" so many times they give up. Hopefully, they give up and leave. A lot of people give up and stay, which only makes the level of apathy across the company worse.

If you do well you do get promoted but then you start at the next grade below the median for that level even if you have already proven to be meeting expectation at the level you are being promoted too. Due to recent changes in how contract labor is managed it has become difficult to get paid help. This makes it difficult to devote time to making anything better in your group since you have to do this kind of work on the side of your regular work. This means that the only real way to advance is to work 'overtime'. Advice to Management:If you want to be an above average company I believe HR should identify at least some above average people and compensate them accordingly.

As a father, I am able to make it to all of my kids' activities, and I have plenty of time off to spend time with them. I also enjoy working with very smart people, and 3M HIS is filled with them. Cons:While I personally prefer getting 401k matching, vacation, good salary, etc. over string cheese, a lot of employees would provide some of the small perks that other software companies are now giving to their employees. They recently started food truck fridays where once a month they provide free lunch to us (this is in addition to other company sponsored activities). They also gave us some free Bose products ($180 headphones, etc.) which were really fun to get. So, in general, they're getting better at providing some warm and fuzzy ""perks."" Advice to Management:The rumor mill runs rampant on the front lines, especially among some of the more jaded/worthless employees. Management would be well served to spend more time on the front line with good employees so they're getting an accurate picture of where we are as a company, and also getting bad employees off the bus much quicker.",5,2016-02-26T00:00:00.000Z,9715045

Cons:The job desc said the QA needed to know Agile but actually 3M HIS doesn't do Agile and doesn't know how to do Agile. The job desc said the QA needed to know how to do automation but at 3M HIS they don't know how to do automation. 3M has core values but respecting co-workers, especially QA professionals, is not one of the core values.

Great people to work with. Solid technology platform. It's truly an Innovations company.,"Software Specialist in Austin, TX","Pros:Technology and Innovation are at the core for whatever product you work on at 3M. The company has some of the best benefits packages, in fact they have reduced some benefits in the recent past, but are still better than most companies. Businesses are organized into Labs, which is good for having a customer focus. Yearly reviews are good and your manager typically let you know how you could contribute more. You will develop wonderful domain knowledge as the work naturally becomes solving a defined problem in the real world. Cons:It's a huge conglomerate with literally thousands of products. In my opinion, 3M failed to develop positive working relationship within different divisions and product groups. For ex., let's say you have to lay off a s/w engineer because that group is not doing so well. You won't see the HR and the management helping the employee to find the job in another division. This happens even when the other division actually has a open job requisition. This is my only reason for giving this company a 4 instead of 5. It's basically ridiculous because the next door division doesn't value the work you do. Advice to Management:1. Have the higher management involve more in the technical work. For ex, I see Technical Directors don't even know all the projects and product platforms their division is involved in. They become so non-technical, only number crunchers, for ex like a marketer. It will serve the company revamp the TD's and even some of the Lab managers. 2. Develope more close work relationship across divisions.",4,2016-02-06T00:00:00.000Z,9480588

Dental Materials Advisor,Pharmaceutical/Dental Advisor in Johannesburg,Pros:3M has always been known for supportive managers. 3M is known worldwide for innovative products that perform to the highest standards. Being an employee of 3M was accompanied by universal company pride Cons:3M products available on the African continent were always subject to the Rand/Dollar exchange and often this put them in an inaccessible price range to a large percentage of the practitioners that were interested to use the products exclusively. Advice to Management:It would be wonderful to provide an in-house generic alternative in the economically depressed countries that allowed practitioners to use the 3M brand without the attendant Rand/Dollar component making products inaccessible to the financially less fortunate communities,5,2016-02-03T00:00:00.000Z,9437539

If you are over 55 and have more than 5 years of experience, they treat you as a 'retiree' and you get a few permanent perks. Cons:3M is a behemoth that really doesn't know what to do with hard manufacturing. They are a chemical, glue, and tape company so when they acquire hard manufactured product they typically try to change it to fit in their existing systems and end up destroying or gutting the acquisition. If you are acquired by them and you make discrete product give it about three years and you will watch a slow descent into oblivion. Managers and product managers who know nothing about your product or what you do will make decisions from four states away that make no sense in any way shape or form. I've seen young women with no experience put in positions of authority and knowledge just because they are a warm body. There is also a lot of emphasis on systems and efforts in the general company that have NOTHING to do with what you are doing but you will be inundated by those efforts. Musical chairs with corporate reorganizations. No innovation in hard manufactured products. Products with 3 year life cycles are forced into their 5 to 10 year product launch program so that by the time you are ready to launch the products are obsolete. It's hard to find this level of incompetence in managing the design process for discrete product but you can find plenty of it at 3M Advice to Management:Stop acquiring hardgoods companies and stick to what you are good at: Process manufactured product.",2,2016-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,9368124

"Good Company, but Out of Touch","Supply Chain Analyst in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:The pay is competitive and the workload is manageable. Because the company is so large and diversified, there are a lot of opportunities to work in different industries and in different roles. Average tenure at 3M is incredibly long (it's not uncommon for employees to have 30+ years at 3M) which I think speaks to the ability to have a career with a lot of variety all at one company. Additionally, there is a strong culture of learning and development. There are constantly seminars and forums for employees to engage in continuous learning and there is generally an enthusiasm around collaboration and continuous improvement. Cons:3M is largely behind other local Fortune 500 companies in terms of benefits for working parents. If you are thinking about accepting a position at 3M and have a family or are considering starting a family in the next 5 years, I would strongly encourage you to discern whether or not you have the financial means to take an unpaid FMLA and/or use all of your vacation time for parenting leave. For maternity leave, you are eligible for 6 - 8 weeks (depending on the type of delivery) of short term disability and any additional time must be taken unpaid. The short term disability benefit varies by years of service, but for most people I know around the office who are expecting they will receive one week of full pay (provided they don't use any sick days in the last 12 months) and 60% pay for the 6-8 weeks. Any leave a new mother wants to take beyond that is unpaid. In the worst case, if a woman must go on bedrest before leave, her family stands to take a huge financial hit. For paternity leave, the official policy of 3m is that one day can be used for the day of the birth. If a father would like to take parenting leave, he can either use vacation or take FMLA unpaid. These policies are in stark contrast to what other local Fortune 500 companies offer (Target recently announced two weeks paid paternity leave and has updated their maternity leave benefits for 2016, Thomson Reuters has 12 weeks paid for maternity and 2 weeks for paternity, UnitedHealth Group also offers 12 weeks paid for maternity leave, Best Buy offers 5 weeks paid for maternity). Additionally, only two weeks of paid vacation is offered to new employees in contrast to other competitors that offer three weeks (Boston Scientific, Target, TR, UnitedHealth Group). Lastly, despite a corporate initiative called ""Flex-Ability"", working from home is still a faux pax and you need to convince supervisors that it can be more productive and often essential to balance the needs of work and home. There is still a strong culture of ""butts in seats"". In an age where companies are acknowledging that employees are retained and more productive when they are able to balance their priorities at work and home, it seems short sighted that 3M likes to boast a competitive compensation package as well as a great company for women when its policies so clearly state the opposite. Advice to Management:It's no secret that the employee base at 3M is aging and many people are retiring. If the company wants to attract new talent, they need to make dramatic changes to parenting leave, vacation, and work accommodations. We live in a day and age where we're increasingly connected and work doesn't need to happen within the hours of 9 - 5 and in a 6x6 cube. Additionally, younger employees increasingly look for jobs that allow emoployees to be good stewards of their company and good parents. It's time to join countless other organizations and continue to make 3M a remarkable company.",3,2015-12-07T00:00:00.000Z,8850573

A high emphasis on years service when considering redundancies cause the company to regularly shed good, young staff. Your loss is another company's gain.

Therefore there is no PTO or benefits package. Upper management does not care how much work you do and are not willing to learn the business that they acquired. I would never recommend this company to a friend or family member. Advice to Management:You will get more productive work out of your employees if you treat them with the respect they deserve.

Production Operator,"Extrusion Operator in Brownwood, TX","Pros:Good benefits with low premiums. Usually plenty of overtime somewhere in the plant. Great pay for the area. That's about it. Cons:SHIFT WORK! WORK/LIFE BALANCE.. Depending on which department you may work in your shift constantly changes. The last department I was in we rotated shifts every week. 1 week of days, then evenings and then grave yard. I knew what I was getting into when I applied but the OT board is what kills you. It's easy enough, if you want OT then you sign the board and if you don't then you don't sign. However there is a accumulative point system that records the number of OT hours offered vs worked. So if no one signs the board whoever has the lowest # of worked hours has to do it regardless of whatever plans you may have for when you get off work. You don't find out if you have to work until your 1/2 way through the shift. It's hard to plan things when your not sure if you will have to work or not. Also they have a point system in regards to punishment. The system escalates from 1-5. No big deal. However one of the most insane things I've ever encountered is being punished for being sick. If you call in sick you get a point for missing the day. But if you stay out 3 days and come in with a DR's note there's no punishment. I just don't get it.

Cons:The main issue is that managers and decision makers from 3M think they know how to manage this business and refuse to listen. They think they know best when most of them are completely clueless to the business, technology and industry issues. They are NOT engaged with the industry and barely with the customers. They hide behind their process and so called best practices. 3M management treat people very poorly. By ignoring the advice given by people who really have the experience, they would then blame them when things are working well. They keep blaming others for their own blatant ignorance and arrogance. Advice to Management:3M Management needs to stop worrying about their own career path. Get off their high horse and arrogance. Be humble and listen. Stop thinking anyone at St Paul can do the job.

Very Depressing Company,"Select One in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Easy life, slow project movements, not hard to please management, good benefits Cons:Being in Minnesota, very hard to convince management to do something new, all the major projects taken by people already at high positions. Mentoring is only a name and followed by few senior level scientists. Most of the scientists are looking to become part of important projects and have their name connected to them. New employees (doesn't matter how good they are) are always seen as secondary inventors, even if everything was their idea. Huge race in technologists to come up with new ideas, so lot of instances of stealing ideas, snatching credits etc. Advice to Management:Management is still in old hierarchy mode, and promotions are dependent on time you are at the company and not the contributions. Promotions are dependent on who you are working with and which project you have, and nothing to do with your actual contributions. So management has to be aware of distributing the good projects among all the employees and not only the favored ones.",1,2015-07-28T00:00:00.000Z,7383085

Not what it used to be,"Senior Software Engineer in Murray, UT","Pros:Pros: - 3M (who owns 3M HIS) is a large and stable company with good salaries and benefits - New ""Flexibility"" program in work hours helps employees coordinate around personal schedules Cons:Cons: - Chaotic work environment with constantly shifting priorities - Risk taking is punished, not rewarded - Very micromanaging/controlling management team - Stale/stagnant technical environment without growth opportunities - Corporate IT policies not friendly to software development Advice to Management:Advice: Company culture comes from the top down and for the last couple of years the culture at 3M HIS has been very toxic. There is constant pressure to work more hours and good people are starting to leave. Despite double digit growth numbers we're made to feel like we're on the edge of collapse. This needs to change! My advice to management is: 1) Listen to your technical teams! (We are a software company where software engineers and technical managers should have a voice.) 2) Remove barriers to work. (Create more meeting spaces with better projectors/whiteboards. Get rid of dumb IT policies like restricting admin rights on developer PCs.) 3) Re-institute 3M's 15% time program. (Didn't know it was gone? Ask around and see how many people feel like they have time for it!) 4) Improve communication and cross training. Remove product/team silos. 5) Slow down the pace. (Limit the number of releases, prioritize work, say no to customers when appropriate, limit one-off features, limit the number of platforms supported.) 6) Get technical teams and customers together. (Site visits, trade shows & summits, ...) 7) Improve morale. (Little perks like occasional team lunches or cookies in the lobby go a long way. Let everyone go home early before Thanksgiving. Add cable/TV to the large television sets in the breaks rooms. Those sorts of things.) 8) Listen to your technical teams! (Important enough to repeat!)",1,2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,7332651
Good Company,"Anonymous Employee in Maplewood, MN","Pros:The majority of the people are good and there is plenty to learn for awhile. They have a great college co-op program and many come back after college. There is many people that have worked there since graduating from college. Cons:A Contractor has learning limits after a few years, because Contractors do not have a career path. If you are the type of person that needs to continually learn, try to get hired. Advice to Management:Do not lose the smart Contractors, hire them....or lose all of that information, only to train again. Does not make sense and only frustrates the Managers, Supervisors, and company employees about direction and commitment.",4,2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,7332617
20+ Yr Employee,"T4A in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Decent employer for the HQ market. Decent pay and benefits. Wide array of opportunities if the role you're in becomes routine (relatively easy to move within the company). Some ability to take risks. Collaborative environment. More than a one trick pony. Cons:HQ campus is depressing. Remodeled buildings remind me of Star Trek Enterprise. Moving to office designs with a communial style (few walls/dividers between workspaces). ""Profit Sharing"" is deferred compensation...was first taken away, then returned the following year...not sure it motivates anyone. Stock options only for managers or equivalents (people generally in second half of their careers). Advice to Management:Lean Six Sigma is a set of tools, not cure-all. Why hire engineers/scientists if you don't value their training? Promoting only your Black Belts doesn't motivate your teams to perform. Senior employees not interested in the gimmic that senior managers never had to endure.",3,2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,7332526
A place where mediocrity is the norm,"Data Scientist in Salt Lake City, UT","Pros:Monthly pay check and that is it. Cons:You wont believe the level of talent (or lack there of) you would see at 3M HIS. People at 3M HIS get into roles that they are completely unqualified for simply because of politics. Seniority is measured in terms of years rather than true competence. This division has no notion of meritocracy. If you can butter up your boss to get ahead, you will eventually win awards and get into higher levels in the company. Otherwise, be where you are for the next 10 to 15 years. Women, as many have mentioned are sidelined in this company - completely stuck in the old mentality. For fresh grads and people who have a bachelors or higher, all of this would be highly soul crushing. Not to mention the zombie like office environment. Unfortunately, the clueless-ness of this division starts from the very top. The competence of the current president is representative of this division. You will see incompetence right from IT to NLP.",1,2015-07-23T00:00:00.000Z,7326443

Cons:Management does not understand technology. Patents are more important than open source and they want to convert everything to Microsoft.

The machines are 40 years old and they break down all the time. 6. HR has a history of ignoring 3M's rules of respectful work place environment. Advice to Management:1. Ask a manufacturing engineer to reevaluate the current production numbers in light of the daily mechanical failures, and with respect to the amount of hand packing involved. 4 packs have a different time reference than 8 packs. 2.

Keep you in a box,"Software Engineer in Silver Spring, MD","Pros:-If you're a talent, you can have a job forever at 3M. Average career is 25 years. -Good benefits Cons:Please note, this applies to only the HIS division: -Division leaders lack vision and are tyrants when it comes to managing talent. They will yell at you in meetings for nothing. -If you're a company that gets acquired by 3M, just run, leave as fast as you can. 3M will suck the culture you've come to enjoy out and will drain any joy you had working there. The 3M way means antiquated ways of managing and thinking which makes sense given that 3M has been around for a 100 years. -If you don't fit into the mental ""box"" they've created for a position, don't expect to get a job you really want. For example, they will only hire MBA's for certain positions even though more competent people can do the job who don't have the qualification. They don't understand what it means to nurture and find ""talent"". -If you're not a member of the talent (sales, product managers, implementation, marketing, etc) expect to have a short leash and be fired quickly for not helping achieve the bottom line. HIS restructures like it's going out of style. -No work from home opportunity. They want people in the office even though they say they are a ""green"" company and despite the fact that the people who work out of the Silver Spring office live in one of the worst metropolitan areas for traffic.

Diverse products: You can always find (or create) something interesting to work on, 3M is literally doing a little bit of everything. Cons:Everyone is a Manager: Despite 3M having separate management and engineering tracks, everyone at 3M is expected to manage in order to further their carriers. Meeting, Meeting, Meeting: Nothing happens at 3M unless it happens in a meeting room. A significant amount of time is spent in meeting rooms rather than in the lab working. Way too many projects: Every engineer is expected to carry a large number of projects, to the point that only an hour or so each day can be devoted to any one project. Advice to Management:Evaluate the promotion path for technical employees. 3M has a large number of talented and creative technical employees who are being overwhelmed by the daily overhead required to ensure they check all the required boxes by the end of the year.

Endless pipeline for development of new products and innovation. Built into its DNA. Excellent corporate resources to utilize and draw from Cons:Long term employees rule the company and have not experienced other workplaces and cultures. This makes it difficult to come into 3M and make a contribution.

3M Production Work - Hutchinson,"Production Worker in Hutchinson, MN","Pros:Good pay Good benefits Good cafeteria - catered food for south plant, grill/salad bar for north plant Cons:Very poor work/life balance. You are expected to work when they want you to. Work scheduling can change depending on ""business needs!"" Expect anything from rotating shift work days-afternoons-nights, to alternating 12's going from days to nights twice per week. They claim to be ""health oriented"" but fail when it comes to understanding health consequences of alternating days/nights and lots of overtime. Mandatory overtime often means long stretches of work without a day off, but this depends on the area and time of year. Do not be expect to be recognized for achievements. The smallest policy violations can lead to poor reviews which inhibit your ability to advance and there is no appeals process that represents the employee. If you disagree with management decisions, an HR rep is assigned to represent you in the process and you are not allowed to attend the appeals decision meetings to speak for yourself. Input from supervisors and managers take precedence over that of employees. The investigation process is extremely biased toward management and does not function objectively. College tuition reimbursement DOES NOT APPLY to production workers. Advice to Management:Stop using the excuse ""the rules come from corporate headquarters."" 3M sites have rules and regulations specific for the culture, location, and function of the facility. Using this excuse underlies the lack of negotiation and people skills this site is well-known for with employees both current and former.

Cons:3M offers a ton of freedom, both in how you work and with whom you work. That's a good thing, but it's also a challenge, because sometimes it's hard to tell who are the people who you can trust to be focused on developing products and technologies that matter, vs. just playing games to look good to management. If you get stuck with the game players, it's really hard to make progress. Advice to Management:Find a way to be more open about the challenges of commercializing technologies and products, and find a way to get rid of people who care only about their careers (vs. trying to accomplish something).",4,2014-12-18T00:00:00.000Z,5564044

Revolving door of managers. Managers make decisions without consulting business team on impact. Managers tend to only talk amongst themselves without taking into account the knowledge and experience of other team members. During annual reviews, it is very hard to be recognized for going above and beyoned because the team setting your evaluation numbers does not know you. Conversely, poor performance is allowed for far too long before it is addressed, creating teams with long-term weak links. Advice to Management:When starting a new line of business, hire experts with the right experience from the outside rather than appointing employees with traditional 3M experience. Consult business team prior to making decisions with critical project impact. Empower employees for success. Recognize people for achievement.

There is a serious lack of accountability to individuals who do not perform. They have gotten away from hiring very many full timers and have gone to working through a temp service.

I hear that some teams are good to work on. Cons:Some teams are very stuck in doing things ""as they've always done it."" You will see other reviewers saying this too. If you have new ideas, you will probably be ignored and shunned by your team mates, especially if they are run by employees who have been there over twenty years. The average time people are employed at 3M is 22 years. This is not something to be proud of because a lot of those people have been in the same job all that time and they don't grow as a person or in their skillsets.

Company has a knack of hiring the best, across all functions. Felt pride working there, even more so now I moved on. Very good 401k and allowance to buy stock. Cons:The overall compensation is below market value. The ""Red Tape"" can be frustrating but to be fair that;s probably of most large, global corporations Advice to Management:Keep on hiring great people.

"Pretty good gig for full-timers looking for a safe job, contractors get a raw deal.","Engineer in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Most people are great. No one on the ground treats contractors any different than 3Mers. Culture varies a lot by group (it's a huge company after all). My group was great, very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. Cons:Hopefully you got a job that interests you because there is little to no chance at advancement as a contract employee. Your manager will probably talk to you about a conversion, but their plans will be subject to 4+ managers and executives above them. Every time one of those positions changes, all plans get reevaluated (and very often thrown out the window). Since most management positions change every 2-5 years you are pretty much guaranteed to be chasing the full-time conversion for 3-6 years, but really it is never guaranteed and I promise you they will try to low-ball you on the offer (make sure you take those years to learn the pay scales and pay attention to min/max/market). Honestly, I had to have had one of the best contracts around (20 hrs per week, I set the hours, pay rate comparable to T3 engineer) but even I grew tired of it after 2 years and got a much better full-time job elsewhere. Advice to Management:Stop pretending that only next quarter matters. Your budget games hurt long-term shareholder value and demoralize your employees. You are in for a world of hurt when you finally realize that the younger workers are not chained to you like the older ones on a pension plan. Over the next 5 years you are letting half your experience walk out the door (retirement) with no effort to transfer knowledge. 5 years after that your most talented middle career employees will start job hunting after years of having multiple jobs dumped in their laps with bellow market pay.",4,2014-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,4883726
Construction Markets Sales Contract Representative Canada,"Construction Supplies Representative in Montreal, QC","Pros:Great name, gre.at products and good people Cons:As a contract employee developing a new department within the company it was not very lucrative as after expenses the pay was entry level and expertise was used to train a salaried employee to do the job and introduce to my contacts. Training was excellent, my only advice is to accept only actual employee of 3M jobs and not contract. I often faced price negotiations with a customer, to find that an existing department was in competition with me and my pricing wasn't adjusted , therefore I was competing with established departments within the company who won bids as they were given better pricing. Being in competition with the company you are representing is not conducive to success nor engagement. Advice to Management:Being in competition with the company you are representing is not conducive to success nor engagement. When hiring contract representatives for their expertise and contacts make sure that they also get the same access to pricing as internal departments. We just look ridiculous in the eyes of our established customer base. The purchase orders 3M gained were far fewer than if equal access was given to contract employees.",3,2014-08-31T00:00:00.000Z,4882228
"Good pay, terrible on everything else",Production Employee,"Pros:They pay really well for simple, brainless jobs. Get long breaks. Good benefits.

They went non smoking in January and With the no smoking thing you cant even GO TO YOUR CAR all you can do is go to their ""designated courtyard"". The company is a big joke. Advice to Management:Care more about the common man! All the workers on the production line are the people that really keep this company going, not the spoiled people in the offices! Stop taking away peoples rights, it doesnt hurt anyone to still allow smoking in the smoke shack.

The benefits are amazing; EAP, health centers, salon, employee discounts, etc. They do seem to try and be consistent and fair to everyone. All opinions matter and safety is #1. I feel free to innovate and try new things. Cons:Its hard for lower level employees to advance but much easier once you get past a certain point. The systems are antiquated and frustrating. The company is so big that things take forever, lots of red tape. They go so big and complicated that it's easy to become frustrated. Because they promote from within, you can't expect to keep the same employees on your team for long. It can cause lost time having to retrain new ppl regularly.

If you can get in as an actual 3Mer and not a contract employee, you get great benefits. Cons:They expect their employees to eat, breathe, sleep, and bleed 3M. They don't care about people as individuals -- everything is about profit, profit, profit and you are a cog in the machine before you are a human being. As a contract employee, they jerked me around -- a lot. And expressing my displeasure with that got me fired. There are also A LOT of meetings.

Horrific Sr Management and poisoned culture,"Management in San Francisco, CA","Pros:Health insurance, corp card, work remotely? Cons:Culture is a poisoned pit and dead! There are no new ideas, products and innovation doesn't exist, all talking points. There are two companies, the older employees with fully funded pensions, just counting down days to cash out and newer employees with no pension, options or opportunities unless you sell your soul to passive aggressive arrogance and incompetence. Have no clue about product development, can only acquire tech and them kill it. Nobody cares because company is so silo'd NOBODY in Sr mgmt is held accountable. When they fail, they're just shipped to another division to ruin that one. Products are all commodities and me too's, they don't belong in healthcare, playing musical chairs with positions every 2-4 years. These divisions are truly run by managers with NO sales, marketing, ops and relevant specific industry experience. This is truly a company to go to if you don't have a career and want to kill one you have. Many that have left had to take 3M off their resumes to get any interest, if that doesn't tell you something. If there was a negative rating, this company would get -5 stars. Advice to Management:Stop confusing the scoreboard with the game, stop lying to yourselves about the ""success"" of your company due to a higher pps over last few years. Stop manipulating revenue to achieve quarterly expectations. Start looking in the mirror. Start Reforming your Managers and all employees through rigid HR training on how and what to say to employees, not allowing and sweeping Illegal behavior under the rug. Start opening eyes to your incompetent, arrogant, clueless peter principled managers throughout and start putting your money on the employees. Pay is horribly inferior in market, HR creates a compa ratio band that ranges from almost 0-150k, so good luck with a worthwhile merit raise. Longtime managers are completely over their heads and many wouldn't be hired several levels below in any other company.

Advice to Management:Be honest, the stand ups are a joke when you try to BS your own employee's. Don't give false hope either, most of the time we hear of all the new recs available but then there's another lay-off and it's not even discussed at the stand ups. Your employee's worry for their job security, and it's not because of their ability to perform, it's because of the companies inability to be honest. Employee's are wanting to move up and explore the company yet there are so many closed doors, be open and discuss more possibilities with your employee's and provide proper compensation - they even have to pitch in for coffee so the company can distribute, at least provide your hard working employee's coffee.",2,2014-06-05T00:00:00.000Z,4353365

Compensation levels vary so widely throughout the departments. Many newer operators doing the same tasks for $10 an hour less plus they don't get the pensions like the older employees but the expectations are the same.

They lost many long-time customers just because of the insulting arrogance of doing so. It's a reflection of the mentality of the leadership of this company.

Confused about technology,Customer Service Manager,"Pros:Strong culture that promotes employee loyalty. Most people who work at large 3M plants (Minnesota, Germany, Japan, Italy) absolutely love it. In MN, specifically, generations of families work at 3M.

"Worked for them for 35+ YRS, Every day I thought I would be fired! A Heck of a Way to Have to Work!","Team Leader in Cordova, IL","Pros:Co-workers, also health & dental insurance. Cons:Management was not worried about the workers, just their meetings, their own advancement and how they could micro manage that on the back's of the average worker! Company is dropping health care for retire's, when I started with them it was guaranteed for life! But just like the management, they have dropped the ball and deserted us! Advice to Management:Remember the retired people who helped make you what you are today! Don't leave them out in the cold as you are doing now!",1,2012-08-27T00:00:00.000Z,1890741
"Good company, innovative and creative.",Business Development Manager in Petaling,Pros:Good basic training and perpectual training for today and tomorrow needs for staff. Cons:Too limited promotion or upper management posts for staff to fill. Advice to Management:Create more lateral promotion opportunities( 3M has diversified products/divisions/projects) for potential staff to fill and specilaised.

Good place but be wary if you cannot handle slow progress.,Senior Engineer,Pros:You could coast by for years with mediocrity and status quo (pro or con). Very friendly people. Lots of resources to use for projects (if allotted) but many other perks of having a lot of people in a company. 401k matching and stable stock. Cons:Cycle of revolving upper management creates a layer of management that focuses more on short term gains that make their numbers look good. Hard workers usually get more work as others on the team ride on the coat-tails to be able to put results on performance reviews. Management usually doesn't know better as communication is not active between management. Lots of 15+years at 3M'ers who are on the status quo coast to retirement. Seems to still be a good ol boys club. Large age gap between management and rank and file which may be due to many hiring freezes in the 90's/2000's and continual push to reduce operational costs. Advice to Management:Update the labs environment from the 1960 - 1980 decor as thats where the money seems to come out of from over the main business buildings. Drab working conditions doesn't bring in talent. Get rid of so many contract workers who have no allegiance to the company or incentive to try and make things better at 3M. Having ground-level HR resources as a contract workers seems counter-intutive.,3,2012-08-26T00:00:00.000Z,1888731
Stuck in the past,Supply Chain Analyst,"Pros:3M is a large company, there are many opportunities (depending on your job function) to move around the company. Benefits and pay are good. Amenities at 3M Center (HQ) are great (fitness center, cafeteria, hair salon, pharmacy). Cons:The company is stuck in it's ways. Unbelievably behind the times. Things are done 'the way 3M has always done them' You waste more time in your day doing everything the hard way (manually) because there are no computer systems robust enough to compete at the level the company tries to compete at. There is an extremely large percentage of people who have been at the company forever and have a 'politics clique' against anyone who challenges their methods or ways of thinking. Management is quick to defend/cover up the errors of long time employees. Advice to Management:Get with the times. The world is changing, 3M needs to as well if the company is going to keep up.",1,2012-08-22T00:00:00.000Z,1875999

Good health benefits. 3M is a big company so the opportunity to work in new areas is a big plus. New pay system encourages employee performance Cons:Slow to change. Company size sometimes inhibits project acceleration. Vacation benefits are slightly below industry standard for experience. Limited risk taking from a coporate standpoint. Advice to Management:More decision making needs to be made at the employee level to acclerate growth.,4,2012-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,1865773
Contract Workers ARE Second Class Citizens at this company.,"Customer Account Analyst in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Famous, well-positioned company that looks good on a resume. Cons:VERY corporate environment. Company is too big, positions overlap. I was hired as a temp, and I was pulled aside by my manager whom told me that I would continue on the project until June, instead of April. On March 30th, my badge didn't work when I went to exit the building. Security then asked for my badge. I knew that something was up. That had never happened. I contacted both the temp agency, as well as my manager to inquire why my badge had been taken away. BOTH my manager and the temp agency IGNORED me on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday; ONLY calling me on Monday to tell me that I was being let go. Fine if you want to dismiss somebody off a job, but at least tell them what is going on and be adult about it. DON'T leave people to worry about their job on a weekend, extremely inappropriate manner in which to dismiss ANY employee, even a temp. Temps aren't any less human than the rest of the work force. Advice to Management:Start analyzing different jobs in the BU's, and you will find that you have three people doing the same job, even two people in different business units. Start respecting temps. I was surprised to know that my story was common for temps. It left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I don't think that I would work for 3M again because of what happened in my case. Perhaps NOW at the current moment, the companies have the upper hand, but one day, that won't be the case. And now, 3M, has more than a hand-full of people that feel disrespected and overlooked (unfortunately because of how they were treated by the company).",2,2012-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,1865376

Very strict business ethics and culture of respect and tolerance for diversity as well as high sense for environmental responsibility. Many different work opportunities within the same company. Excellent reputation for high quality products and innovativeness. Stable business growth creating secure work places. Cons:Extremely complex matrix organisation structure with chronically underressourced teams that are supposed to achieve outstanding reasults by coincidence. Very poorly designe structures for customer-facing and external business subserving tasks. Far too much administration and formalized processes creating internal friction and reducing time and energy for more meaningfull external and customer-oriented work. Too many initiatives and programms that seem to serve more as career boosters for the individuals who introduce them instead of making real positive impact on business results and culture. Filling of higher level job grades very intransparent. Latent attitude of risk-aversity. Little possibility to develop fast for real talent. Advice to Management:Trust people instead of formalism. You can't formalize everything, especially with the extremely complex systems, processes, and organizational structures that you have.

Have to seek it out on your own. Not the best health care for employees with families Slow pay increase system Advice to Management:Get the feeling that most managers are only concerned about moving up the ladder. As a result, they aren't afraid at times to throw you under the bus or agree with unrealistic goals/ideas so long as their reputation is intact. My advice: We are a team and you are our coach. No one is going to give their best effort for a coach who is only concerned with his/her own performance review.

In research, you're given a lot of schedule flexibility, you feel valued and respected.

Disheartening,"Anonymous Employee in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Diversification of the company and the industries it serves. The company has a tremendous technical platform and technical staff. Cons:3M states that it supports career development. I think they would like to think that but they do not have the proper tools in place nor the execution of that phiilosphy. I believe a deeper commitment from HR to properly resource such a concept is necessary to truly walk the talk. Advice to Management:The company needs better leadership development. There are pockets of good leadership but there is much that is lacking in areas as well. The culture is an oppressive culture for new people entering the organization.

"Strange company, level of internal politics and negativity stifling.","Interactive Marketing in Maplewood, MN","Pros:If you are coming in to 3M with previous digital expertise, you will notice immediately the need to educate your peers, which can be a good thing, and can become taxing. My particular manager seemed to never be there, so working flex hours was not an issue, but can't speak to other teams. The work load was not too extensive for me, but that may have been due to the in-fighting across teams that allowed very little to get assigned and done. They had a decent web mail client, which, given managers' propensity to answer and send all emails after 8pm was a life saver. Cons:I would not know where to start here. Most employees have been there for 10-20+ years, so this particular division did not take kindly to outsiders. The in-fighting between teams was so extensive that I was given a list of people to ""not respond to via email or phone."" I was also told not to attend meetings without approval from my manager to ensure my expertise was not ""stolen"" by ""the enemy."" Yuck. I was closed off from projects I offered the most seasoned expertise in, due to senior leadership very much disliking each other. It was disappointing to not get to leverage my expertise in an arena that so badly needed it, and the constant back-stabbing and bad-mouthing of co-workers that started on day one and never stopped made me very uncomfortable. Also, I was constantly asked to tap my network of digital vendors, agencies and resources to produce RFPs or work for 3M at the 11th hour that never went anywhere. Great way to ruin long-standing working relationships outside of the company. I was not aware of anyone who seemed ""happy"" working there compared to other companies I have worked for. No one smiled, ever. I finally had to start working on projects without telling my manager just to ensure I was doing anything at all and that I was helping them from spending way too much for way too little or just simply doing something not aligned with their audience/customer needs. From a sheer ""company"" perspective, the oddities at 3M Healthcare were endless. There were no refrigerators for employees to store lunch, beverages, etc. It may not sound like a big deal - try it sometime. The lunchroom was open very briefly every day, and offered the worst, most unhealthy and expensive selection of food (if you got there in time to get any) I have ever seen, anywhere. To avoid waste, they provided less food than needed, and anything edible was gone immediately. There's nothing but fast food around there, so going off-site was not a better option. I spent my first three days literally sitting in an empty cube with no computer (which can be typical) but also with nothing to read, ramp-up on, or anyone coming by to say hello or get me situated, manager included. I had to train myself on all systems and getting logins to do so was far more frustrating and time-consuming than usual. The commute is horrid, too, unless you live out that way. There was no discernible process to anything, and trying to instill any was futile. I had to ask folks many times for things they'd promised to deliver, to little avail. I never really knew what I was supposed to be working on, what would come up as ""due"" at any time, or what would be summarily cancelled or taken off my plate - all of this was due to politics. I spent more time in meetings about projects that never moved forward (or that at least our team was ""kicked off of"") than in meetings about viable projects. I attempted to address all of these issues over and over, to no result, and ended up having to print and save the nasty emails between teams their managers to ensure I was never ""blamed"" for something I was not involved in. Not fun. It might be fine for folks that have been there forever, and other divisions may be more advanced in their collaboration and politicking skills not to mention digital savvy. I didn't stay long enough to find out. I actually saw one person start and quit within a week while I was there. If you offer valuable expertise and have worked for other companies be ready for a massive culture shock. Advice to Management:Play nicely, and serve the customer, not your egos, infighting or chest-beating. Leverage expertise that you did not previously have internally when it is offered to you. Stop talking badly about other managers to their team members, and do not slight their team members or discount their expertise due to your own upper-level politics. Plan, and then follow through. Work smart, not hard, and use the proper vendors/agencies for what you are trying to accomplish, rather than agencies you are ""friends with"" who may not have the skills needed to do the job. If you are going to swear and talk badly of others, close your office door. Sitting outside your office and hearing it all day is not fun and quickly lowers morale. DOn't spend a team status meeting taklking badly of other teams/managers. Realize that a nice mix of 3M-seasoned managers, and managers from other companies is a GOOD thing, not a competition.",2,2011-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,911352

Mother mining acting like a step mom.,Manufacturing Manager,"Pros:Movement between jobs. OK salary, Good people to work with. Many opportunities if in the right division.

The harder you lick, the quicker you advance.No respect for the crew in the field, rather.......monthly beat-downs provided in the shape and form of monthly 'coaching calls' by your manager....usually some guy/girl looking for advancement and see you as a potential threat .

Do Your Homework,"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Location. Stable- depending on where you are in the corporation. Ample opportunity for lateral movement to try different things. Cons:Below average compensation and benefits. There is NO work/life balance at 3M unless you've been there for a long time! If you do stand your ground and not let them stomp on you, you'd better be happy with where your at because you'll never get anywhere. The 3M philosophy is to suck you in, dump on you until they break your back and then spit you out. They don't care about retention of good talent which is very saddening. Best part is management knows this! My manager keeps telling me to put various things on my resume.. Very Political! Lots of headstrong people with big egos and personal agendas. Advice to Management:Wake Up! Promote trained and qualified people from within. Treat employees like humans and you might be surprised with the outcome.",1,2010-06-27T00:00:00.000Z,548171
3M is a typical large corporation,"Anonymous Employee in Maplewood, MN","Pros:It’s a big company, so there is a lot of room to move around and lots of opportunities. 3M is big into advanced education so the tuition reimbursement is second to none. In truth, if you work hard and do a good job of networking there are opportunities to grow and advance. Cons:Because of it's size it can be very difficult to get notice, you really do have to network. It is very much who you know not what. There are also a lot of people hiding out waiting to retire. The evaluation system is complete BS, ratings are based on almost everything but performance. Advice to Management:Please change the evaluation system, whether you got a promotion or if you neighbor got a 4 should have no barring on whether or not you get a 4 or a 5. Additionally, We are too rigid in our requirements for our jobs. I've seen some people not even considered for job that they could have done well at just because their degree didn't match what HR thought was required.",3,2010-06-24T00:00:00.000Z,544644
Great,Supply Chain Analyst,"Pros:Great opportunity for advancement, and a huge selection of fields to choose from. 3M is one of the most diverse companies I've seen. If you can handle working for a very large company then this is one of the top companies to work for. Cons:It's a large company, so there are a lot of rules and policies which can be good and bad.

Pretty good,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:The benefits, flexibility and job opportunities made 3M a great place to work. I enjoyed the majority of my time there. Cons:Not much. Sometimes felt that management was top heavy. Everyone seemed to be in a manager position and I would be reporting to several different people on different projects.

Only if you have family in high positions will you get anywhere at 3M.,Supply Chain Engineer,"Pros:Good benefits, ""nice"" people, well defined structure and business goals. Cons:People are ""nice"" to your face but then turn around and do the opposite of what they promised. Minnesota ""nice"" is actually a cowardly fake. People are too afraid of opposition and conflict to have healthy debate. If you are confident enough to state your opinion then beware because you will slowly be closed out and eventually blacklisted from career advancement/opportunity. You definately have to know the right people and be in with the right people to get promotions or even new different jobs. It is crazy that your current supervisor is your career mentor and controls whether you can interview or put in for other jobs. Very stifling environment and no appreciate for experience out side of 3M. If you have experience prior to 3M consider it null and void because no one will acknowledge it and they certainly don't want to hear about it. Advice to Management:Take a hard look at yourself. The brightest and best are not at 3M because they wouldn't put up with the political BS, they can control their own destiny.",3,2010-06-10T00:00:00.000Z,526687
Great place to work,"Anonymous Employee in Pasadena, CA","Pros:The company offered good benefits, interesting work, and the managers cared about the work/life balance. They also offered social activities for staff morale-building.

Widely-held views from the 3M labs.,"Anonymous Employee in Maplewood, MN","Pros:3M is involved in a wide variety of technology platforms, which means a scientist or engineer can work in different fields throughout his/her career. It also means that it is possible to transfer between divisions when you need a change! Cons:Unfortunately, the promotions/rewards system currently in place do not encourage long term high-risk research as much as short term, low-risk projects. Advice to Management:Management should reward high-risk paradigm-shifting research, even if it does not result in immediate sales. Otherwise, technical staff will naturally choose to do low-risk, short term projects, which probably will not result in breakthrough discoveries.",4,2010-05-31T00:00:00.000Z,515376
This program is perfect for engineering students who are interested in R&D.,"Tech Aide in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:You will learn a lot about how to refine the way you think about research and product development. Working here will improve the integrity of your work and documentation skills. It also teaches students a lot about working in a corporate environment. Cons:Currently, contract employees are treated as second rate citizens, with no opportunity for an in. They are frequently dismissed when they inquire about secure job opportunities and will be kept on-hand for years without being hired permanently. They get no paid vacation, no bonus, and no opportunity for advancement.... aside from the pay, being a tech-aide is actually more advantageous since you can have access to many more company resources. This program, however, is only available to students. As a tech aide, you simply won't learn some things if you just don't ask so be sure to fulfill your curiosity by asking questions about the tasks which you perform. Otherwise the job can become quite boring and monotonous. Advice to Management:Push for recognition of the contract talent. Help them with their career aspirations if they show real ambition.",4,2010-05-30T00:00:00.000Z,514509
3M make you Redundant or redesignate job grade on the pretence of restructuring if you do not polish the top management,"3M Malaysia, Petaling Jaya - Consumer & Office Group in Petaling Jaya","Pros:Great intranet resources. Great Six Sigma training program Great place to improve political skill set Great place to learn how to polish shoes of the top management Great place to learn for stepping stone purpose. Cons:Only those with great polishing skills will be in the good books of the top management. Red tape approval on simpliest consumer promotion acivities. Terrible place to work for those with FMCG experience. YOu will loose your FMCG skill sets. Penny wise Pound foolish investment strategy. 3M finds reasons to make you redundant or terminate you once you are not in their good books. Consumer group employee average tenure is 6 months to 1 year before they leave the company or gets booted out of the company. 3M terminates your service when economic downturn comes around. Every single downturn they have terminated people. Advice to Management:The Leadership Team(LT) in 3M Petaling Jaya do not have the guts to challenge their own MD if actions taken by MD are inappropriate, drastic, harsh and unjust. There are many useless old ""pets"" kept at the Group Management level who dare not speak up to protect their own staffs as they will be afraid they will loose their own job. Most LT only ""talk the talk"" and not ""walk the talk"" to lead their team. They are either not innovative or inexperience when it comes to Consumer business. You cannot use the same skill set of selling industrial goods for Consumer product.",1,2010-05-15T00:00:00.000Z,498513
"In general, if you just want a job and some sort of job security, 3M would do.",Anonymous Employee,"Pros:If you are working as a full-timer, it might not be a bad place to work in terms of job security. Cons:I haven't seen much of challenge in terms of professional development. There is lots of political bickering going on too.

"Incompetence, nepotism, swearing at employees, threats.","Lead Design Analyst in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Benefits, location, environment, interesting and challenging work. Many wonderful people to work with. Cons:Incompetent and unqualified management, nepotism, the cousin of the manger that brought her in the department secretly, got the job that I earned. When I brought up to the director the qualifications of my manager he said, ""you tell anyone what happened to you and I will kick your ass."" , while the HR manage sat next to me and said nothing. An upper level manager used the, ""F"", word to me twice in a meeting while my manager sat next to me and said nothing and when reported nothing was done about it and if you did that to a manager at 3M they would walk you out the door. People advanced not by their accomplishment or contributions but by who they sucked up to and that is the 3M way. Those envolved in nepotism should be fired no matter how long ago it happened. However, 3M management can't handle that problem either when nepotism is their fault it says on the application, ""do you have any relatives that work here."", and 3M let her come in the department and move ahead. She advanced three job classes in a year and a half and is there a red flag there? Advice to Management:Get qualified people in their jobs and promote people by their contributions and according to the qualifications I saw there for jobs I am qualified to be the CEO and I have told the CEO, I want the job.",2,2010-05-07T00:00:00.000Z,489643
"Rewarding place to work, Family Friendly,","Research Engineer in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Flexible hours are accepted for most non-production positions. I am trusted to do my work and 'put in the hours"" (45+) on average. No body is looking over your shoulder to make sure and this leads to an environment where people feel appreciated and willing to go the extra mile when needed. People of all types work here and I have not seen nor heard of any of the types of racial/other discrimination that a few other reviewers talked about. My guess is that if they are not advancing, they either have a poisonous attitude or are not performing as well as they think they are. One of my favorite parts of working in the technical community here is the copious amounts of learning opportunities, whether it be a Tech Forum class, a cold call to any researcher no matter how senior, or general networking. For one who likes to learn and build/contribute on others' knowledge, there is no better place to work than 3M that I know of. Cons:If you think that just showing up is 80% of the work, this is not the place for you. Some people may slide by, but don't know how they live with themselves. Bureaucratic red tape is a fact of life in a large entity like 3M. Not fun, but one learns to work effectively within that framework. Advice to Management:Do not forget the value of patient money, ever! (R&D spend) Don't allow good contractors waiting for an ""in"", sit around too long. Once you have seen their value, hire them! To ignore this is to risk our intellectual property, both present and future.",5,2010-05-05T00:00:00.000Z,487894
The land before diversity. The 1950's are alive and well and living in Minnesota.,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Diversity in geography, products and markets helps the company weather financial storms better than many corporations. Employment is relatively stable and it's better than being unemployed. Cons:If you're male and white, you're in heaven here. If you're not both, it's an exercise in futility. Save your time and your sanity. If you're black, you will never go anywhere here. There are virtually no black executives, almost no black middle managers, virtually no black representation even in human resources and/or ""diversity management"". There are no diversity initiatives. Equal pay for equal work does not exist, color-wise or gender-wise. Pay for performance does not exist. It's good old boys tapping good old boys on each others' shoulders. If you're particularly talented, you can be sure that you will be kept buried and muzzled deep within the bowels of the organization. Frustration and/or exit are the only logical results. Advice to Management:The best talent resides in a diversity of people. New markets and new innovations are often best seen by looking at input from a variety of vantage points. Systemically disengaging everyone who is not a ""good old boy"" hinders growth. It also poorly positions the company for the inevitable future of an increasingly diverse society. It's obvious that there is no support for diversity at the top. This attitude permeates the entire organization. For above average growth to be generated, looking beyond the usual places and the usual suspects must occur. Challenge management to include a diverse slate of candidates for every promotion and, in particular, every management position. Integrate. Innovate. Tap change agents within the organization. You'd be amazed at how much hidden talent exists, duct-taped and handcuffed within the company. Unleash these folks and see a ground swell of new growth and creative solutions to old problems. There are a number of positive things about the company, but the lack of appropriate people power utilization threatens them all.",1,2010-04-24T00:00:00.000Z,475935
The name on the resume is worthwhile but not a happy place to work.,"Accounts Payable in Maplewood, MN","Pros:The internship program is good and they are actively working to make it better. They have a lot of services for employees. The benefits are changing and while not as good as they once were they are still not bad. Cons:Too big, you are just a number. Stifling atmosphere. People are just counting their time to retirement. Not an upbeat place to work. Not enough variety in duties, everything is very compartmentalized. Too much emphasis on degrees and where they came from. Advice to Management:Lighten up, take off the starched collars and interact with the employees, you might find some great hidden talent.

EC&DP is not transparent.,3M Sales Representative,"Pros:Interesting products and nice colleagues. 3M is a large company with opportunities all over the world. Cons:Unfortunately are these opportunities only for a small selection of candidates bearing the name ""high potential"".

Great Experience!,Tech Aide,"Pros:This job is great experience for science undergrads. Sometimes you end up doing your boss' grunt work, but it pays pretty good for a part time job and they treat you well. Cons:You will do the same thing over, and over, and over again. Depending on your placement, you may or may not be doing something relevant to your education. Advice to Management:Recognize your Tech Aides and all the work they do to keep 3Ms research going. Without them, there would be a huge lag in research.",3,2010-02-24T00:00:00.000Z,411414
Market Research Supervisor,Market Research Supervisor,"Pros:Flexibility of management to time off requests. 3M has a vast amount of resources with a ton of products giving you the opportunity to work with all kinds of products/business channels. Cons:As a contract employee you recieve no PTO, no benefits, nothing. Also, salaries are slightly lower than if you were an actual 3M empployee, which is backwards to most. Most companies pay professional contract emplloyees slightly higher becuase they don't have to pay them PTO & benefits. Advice to Management:Cut NASCAR. This is the only marketing tactic that does not have to be tied to a ROI. 70% fo 3M revenue comes from b2b. Bring back the sports boxes to take customers to, that is certainly cheaper than a season of supporting a NASCAR team.",4,2010-02-22T00:00:00.000Z,407779
Great place to work!,"Technical Aide in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Great opportunities for future growth and career development. Respect given by management, and ability to work to your potential. Team work and great leadership. Cons:3M is a very large company and can sometimes make it harder to be noticed and recognized for your efforts by upper level management. However, strong effort is made to recognize those who contribute greatly. Advice to Management:For the hiring process sometimes degree titles should be overlooked in cases where a degree doesn't specifically say the word ""engineer"". The lack of that term doesn't mean that a candidate is not qualified to be an engineer with a scientific degree with engineering background and experience. I believe too much stock is placed on the degree title and school it came from. Very strong candidates can come from small schools with great degree programs.",5,2010-02-11T00:00:00.000Z,396199
Good Place to Work!,"Executive Assistant in Bedford Park, IL","Pros:Family friendly, excellent pay, great benefits, flexible schedule of hours, good communication, good working conditions, management was very personable. A good place to work. Cons:Old warehouse, needed alot of updating, could only advance so far at this location due to everyone staying until they retired!

"Great place to start a career, the name will carry a lot of weight with higher paying employeers","Sales Training Supervisor in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Surround yourself with some very passionate people Cons:you can often find yourself working for someone from an entirely different business unit, unfortunately their experiences leave them as a fish out of water and they offer little value in their new role, their lack of business knowledge and lack of network can inpede your advancement. Compensation at 3M is another negative, as you can see in the salary area, 3M jobs from entry level to Director level are at least 20% lower than comparable Fortune 500 companies Advice to Management:Get back to treating your employees as if they are highly valued. 3Mers realize that they could always make more elsewhere, but when they were treated as important the moral was high.",3,2010-02-08T00:00:00.000Z,392374

Great Job while in school,"Technical Aide in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:3M is an interesting, exciting, and fun place to work. With different divisions, it encompasses all job types from medical to chemical, research and development, international, administrative, and many others. I truly enjoyed working there and learned so much using machines and processes I would never have been able to use while attending college. Cons:While working in the Research and Development area, I found the majority of the people I worked with to have trouble interacting with others. I believe this is because the majority of the people I worked with were PhDs and were very very very focused on their work. However, I couldn't even get a friendly hello out of them in the hallway. This social ineptitude showed in our meetings and management strategies as the meetings dragged on and very little got accomplished. Advice to Management:Provide more professional leadership and management training for team and project leaders while at 3M. Not just Six Sigma or other similar programs.",4,2010-01-28T00:00:00.000Z,380584

"Talented people often led by senior management that's ""out of touch""",Senior Product Manager,"Pros:Great place to work in terms of working with real talent in the trenches.

"Not what it used to be... in my opinion, 3M no longer values seasoned sales professionals that can really deliver.",Senior Account Representative,"Pros:Good name recognition when calling on customers, however, all too often, Some quality products and quite a few quality employees are still left, but they are getting frustraited and will likely leave soon, given the opportunity. Cons:Overall poor product line management - marketing personnel turnover is too quick resulting in lack of true understanding of customers and very importantly, not being held accountable for poor decisions made that sales people have to live with, resulting in very upset customers. Poor shipping and support causes customer frustration - management turnover is so frequent that they do not understand or develop long term relationships with key customers, as a result, they appear to make short term decisions that may help the bottom line for a year, but really harm the bottom line in future years and also harm customer relationships. Extrememly poor training, used to train sales people in one way or another every year, now, good luck with getting any real training. Advice to Management:Invest in your employees, stop milking the experienced ones and then running them off. Used to, 3M paid slightly higher than average wages/benefits, but no longer - as a result, employees are no longer willing to put up with the severe BS - you pay for mediocre, you get mediocre, not the top performers you used to get. You take away profit sharing, stop options and raises for your field sales reps and force them to use ALL of thier accrued vacation in one single year instead of over a two to three year period, no wonder people are leaving left and right. Sad thing is that the people that made these decisions and implemented these policies will probably leave or retire before they are held accountable for implimenting them.",2,2009-12-26T00:00:00.000Z,350714
"Beware your incentive pay, vacation",Process Engineer,"Pros:Stable company with very diverse markets Some products are very cutting-edge technology Good mid-level management Many of their factories are in small towns where it is cheap to live, if you like living in small towns Pay is decent Cons:Company holds back a percentage of your pay each month for salaried employees, and based on how the company and division perform in the year, you get a payment in March. If the company exceeds their plan, you get a bigger payout. If they have a rough year, you get less or maybe not anything at all if it is really bad. But beware their trickery! This year they changed it from US & International sales to solely US sales. International was the bulk of business, so they found a way to pay their employees less. New changes to their vacation policy are also upsetting. All vacation is given at the beginning of the year and must be used by Dec 31st, or it disappears. Problem is, some years the plants will close down at Christmas so everybody saves their vacation until the end of the year. Then when end-of-the-year orders come through, everybody has to work. So either take your vacation in the summer and take leave without pay in December, or hold on to your vacation and watch it disappear in December when you're buried in work. Advice to Management:The employees know when they're being taken advantage of. Treat them like they're valued and they'll be loyal. Keep taking benefits away, that loyalty will vanish.",3,2009-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,344199

Innovation is rewarded through technical career ladders and formal award processes and celebration. Cons:The benefits package is so good that there is little room to move upward as people are not leaving the company often. Advice to Management:Let go of some of the bureaucracy in order to foster more creativity.

A good place while it lasted,"Anonymous Employee in Cincinnati, OH","Pros:The basis of the company was sound with good culture, strong professional skills, and interesting work Cons:3M was very bureaucratic which slowed down our progress significantly. 3M had a lot of internal politics and infighting which lessened the value of efforts and caused churning to meet internal needs instead of focusing on the external goal. Ultimately, the direction set within 3M and the level of support for a potential winning product was the downfall of 3M Precision Optics.

Sales focused - not good at seeing the big picture,"Marketing in Bracknell, England","Pros:BIg varied company - potential to work in a number of different businesses. Dedicated people, many of whom have been there a long time. Good external reputation Cons:Sales focused - no real idea about marketing. Spent a lot of money in the last couple of years developing a marketing excellence programme, but haven't had the guts to follow it through. Obsessed with detail and data, but won't spend the money on customer research to find out what customers really want. Very technology and manufacturing focused. Low morale amongst marketers who feel undervalued and unable to utilise their skills, and sick of the short term obsession with intricate financial detail. There is a tendency to trust 'the system' rather than the knowledge and experience of the marketers. Advice to Management:Implement the marketing excellence programme, and listen to your customers in all businesses, especially the consumer facing ones. Take a longer term view on marketing spend - acept that some programmes will not deliver in the same financial year. Put in place the systems and resopurces to actually allow your marketers to measure the success of their programmes - hard sales numbers are very important, but so are local brand strengths and perceptions. Launch products, instead of just letting them escape Allow sales and marketing to work together - the current structures just line up fights Let us meet and share best practices with our International colleagues - and then credit us with having the knowledge to understand our own markets and the ability to identify what is appropriate for our customers.

3M,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:I think overall there is a sense of family within the work group. People are helpful, and I have not found it to be a cut throat place to work. People support jobs well done and encourage areas of growth. Cons:Sometimes management is a little slow to make decisions, and I agree with the previous review that decisions are sometimes reactive as opposed to proactive. I also think that they need to pay closer attention to the opinions of those closer to the process as they are the experts. Advice to Management:Listen to those closer to the process, such as production operators, engineers, etc. Communication could be improved sometimes.

Opportunities to move around the company, lots of variety and opportunities. Cons:Senior management is weak, and very parochial. Key attribute to be able to move ahead is loyalty to the right guy.

No diversity, almost all management is older, white males. They treat women very badly and it's obvious.

Decent place to work,"Engineer in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Solid technology company and talented personnel. Cons:Volatile environment and frequent layoffs. 3M changed from being a place where people worked forever to a place where people frequenly leave. It is probably no different from most corporations today, but it is certainly a huge culture shift for this corporation. Also, there are lots of systems for everything which impede the progress of projects unnecessarily.

3M Industrial Sales in a nutshell.,"Account Representative in Boston, MA","Pros:3M is a great company with a long track record of developing new products and great employees. Everyone that works at 3M is generally happy, and have been with the company for a long time. 3M creates a nice work life balance, and generally promotes managers who have good people skills, and genuinely care about their employees. 3M has deep pockets, and can do somethings that other companies might not be able to do as far as discounting products, and providing technical and sample support which can really help a sales rep win in the field. Marketing also does a nice job of communicating with the sales reps. Overall, 3M really is a great place to work, and morale is generally very high. Cons:When I worked for 3m they had just got done going through a lot of changes (guided by Jim McNerney and Six Sigma) that cut a lot of the innovative side of the business out of 3M. The effect that this had (in my opinion) is that a lot of the ""value"" was stripped out of 3M's product offerings. What customers have come to expect from 3M is that they offer new and innovative approaches to everyday problems that customers face when manufacturing products, or performing everyday tasks necessary to keep a business running. The new CEO, George Buckley, has been playing catch-up the past few years now in order to supplant the lack of innovation by acquiring other companies. Whether this approach has worked, and or will work, remains to be seen. Advice to Management:The view that the majority of sales reps had was that the senior management was always trying to find ways to hold sales reps back from being compensated on the commission piece of their compensation. I would encourage them to develop a council (that includes senior and junior sales reps) that helps to create a more fair and motivating system of compensation.",4,2009-03-23T00:00:00.000Z,195369

The benefits are pretty good, but things are starting to be taken away. There are worldwide opportunities available, but harder to come by these days. Cons:Some times management lives in silos. Doesn't give opportunities to people willing to take them. Management plays it safe and doesn't take too many risks. They are worried too much of what the ""street"" has to say. The work can be mundane. Communication is something that needs to be worked on. To move around, you've got to know some one.

Cons:Salary not reflective of the amount of work em-ployees put in to career, bonus structure has very recently changed- negatively I might add.

No opportunities to move International. No motivation to drive change. Past history of starting new initiatives and then when the going gets tough, management pulls the plug. Most of the high-performing people who are here stay only because of their pension.

"Needs less red tape, more backbone.","Senior Engineer in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:At the grass-roots level 3M is a great place to work. Work/life balance is good, rarely is there more than occasional overtime to get the job done. Lots of new products, and a culture that seems to do a good job in preventing 'siloing' of people. In some places there are resources being brought to bear on products that are utterly awe-inspiring. Cons:Big company red tape, not as bad as my last employer though. Lack of fortitude and commitment on the part of middle management is a real problem. Advancement and promotion are entirely based on politics. Communication from above is spotty at best, misleading at worst. Advice to Management:Empower middle management. No decision of any importance in 3M is made below the rank of Director. We might as well not even have managers apart from handling HR paperwork. This is a mixed blessing, as the quality of middle management in the company is very hit or miss. Some really good managers, some not worth their weight. I suggest cutting one good layer's worth of management out of most of the company.",4,2009-02-23T00:00:00.000Z,178660
"Once proactive, now reactive.","Marketing in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Global company with many opportunities in a variety of career options and locations. Wonderful products and many great, hardworking people still work there. Compensation and benefits are competive. Overall, conservative with expenses. Cons:Senior employees are ""conveniently"" weeded out in favor of younger, less costly to keep employees. Nepotism and buddy systems are blatant: friends and family are mentored and promoted over ""not connected"" qualified candidates. Employee job performance feedback is ineffective - subjective with quotas on how many can receive higher grades (often reserved for those on the ""fastrack"", regardless of ability). Programs are implemented without good planning or reason just to show that management is ""doing something"". Advice to Management:Be proactive, not reactive. Respect the employees who once made this company great. Don't manage by fear. Encourage, motivate, respect, and appreciate those you manage. Retire the ""good ol' boys"" at the top who still like to make and break those who don't agree with them.

Slave to the Man,"Engineer in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Its a large company with lots of diversity of products. You have many options, if the company is doing well. Cons:I'm not certain that they care about their employees and their relations with their employees. Rather than being straightforward with decisions or showing confidence with decisions, they wait until the last minute to make decisions. The true test of how great a company is to work for is how they treat their employees in downturns. 3M is not demonstrating to me that its a company I will want to stay with for my career. Advice to Management:Be honest and forthcoming with employees. Don't leak some information and then change your mind 5 million times. If we need a layoff, have a freaking layoff... don't make the company hellish for all employees.

There is a great deal to be learned from the many employees who have been there for 30+ years - excellent information sharing across businesses. Generous benefits. Cons:For a company so well known for innovation, resistance to new ideas in some businesses is perplexing. The culture promotes stagnancy in many respects. It is often those who don't rock the boat and can play the internal politics game well who rise to the top. Senior Management often lacks the impressive resume and accomplishments found at other peer companies.

innovative company with opportunity for advancement,"Senior Engineer in Nevada, MO","Pros:3M has a culture that allows innovation without punishment for failure. Lean six sigma is one of the main reasons for 3M's success in keeping costs down and hiring outstanding people. Communication from the middle management down is good so I assume communication down the chain of command to all levels is the same. Compensation and benefits are in line with the industry standard although there have been some changes. We'll have to see what the industry does. Morale is high considering the economy and the tough decision from St. Paul. Management shows a great deal of respect to the employees. Cons:The culture of ""that is the way we have always done it"" is alive and well within all ranks. This is starting to change in the production area but is slow to be adopted in other areas. One of the downsides is some of the plants are in small towns. This is not always a downside but if you want a good meal you may have to drive for it as well as going shopping. This also limits the potential employee pool and makes it difficult to get an outstanding engineer or manager into your plant due to the location.

3M-Still a great place to work-if you're a young boot licker.,"Retired Supply Chain Manager in Austin, TX","Pros:Innovative work is rewarded, but you must toot your own horn, as management expects your best all the time. Benefits were excellent for a long time, but are lessening as times change. Flex time in Austin is encouraged, making for less stress. Open building design encourages more interaction between sales/marketing/engineering/lab. Cons:Questionable selection of management, placing untested people in level 14 jobs who have never gone through the ranks. Expectations that a canoe can move just as fast with 10 oars and only 4 rowers. Salaries are lower than at other equally rated jobs in the Austin area since they are tied to national averages. Advice to Management:Really listen to the people who are doing the real work, don't just give the opinion surveys lip service. Give more credit to the loyal, long-term employees who think that ""Mother M"" still exists. They will serve you better than the young upstarts you are moving up the ladder.",4,2008-12-17T00:00:00.000Z,134717
Resources cut left and right does not create a growth engine.,"Senior Product Development Engineer in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Many opportunities to move into other jobs for especially sales, marketing, business, chemists, and engineers. Diversity of projects and people. Culture of innovation is still around. Most employees are happy to work at this company because of interesting projects and advanced technology. Very few employers have the breadth of knowledge available to the 3M community. Cons:Innovation has taken a real hit. Creativity is stifled by management who only sees one quarter ahead. Not willing to take big risks for fear of failure. The ""old 3M"" which means something different to everyone really never existed, but the reason it keeps coming up (how things were better at the ""old 3M"") is because there has been a slow decline over many years in terms of project resources, benefits, management communication to employees, and creativity. Advice to Management:Emphasize 15% time. Speed up the development time of new projects by applying more resources where needed rather than demanding that a project be completed by Date X.",3,2008-11-18T00:00:00.000Z,118150

Employees are encouraged to come up with even incremental process and product improvements. Coworkers are very cooperative. There are very few barriers to information sharing. You can go across the campus to another lab and get the resources you need for your project. Cons:To succeed in 3M, you have to be working in a core technology such as films, adhesives or biochemicals. If you are in a support group or division, opportunities for exciting projects or career advancement are limited. Mid level managers seem to have very little power. They have very limited ability to help their direct reports in performance improvements until it is too late.

We are prodivded the tools and traning necessary to do our jobs and do them well. We have support from immediate and upper management when any issues arise and very quick response to correct them.

avoid this employer,R&d Senior in Seoul,"Pros:Steady work with reasonable benefits and pay. The working pace is amenable to people who seek a ""life balance"" and don't wish to be slaves to the job.

The work place is pretty diverse in terms of people and almost any lifestyle is acceptable as long as you show up when you are supposed to and try to accomplish something. Flexible working hours are accepted. Being in Health Care instead of some of the other 3M businesses is a huge plus. Health Care is very profitable, how is life making sand paper or roofing granules?

"3M, a PROUD company to work for","Product Manager in Ames, IA","Pros:Lots of good benefits and opportunities are available at 3M. Bosses are usually hands off (perhaps because they are so entangled in meetings). It is a great company to work for, as there are a ton of extracurricular activities outside of work hours. The company has a good pay/job grade system that allows fair transition from one job grade to the other, and fair annual rate increases, based on job grade, EC&DP evaluation and goal accomplishments. It is also a great opportunity for employees to be able to be part of a profit-sharing benefits package. However, most of all, the best reason to work at 3M is the ability to buy Post-It notes at cost, besides all the tapes and other products 3M makes. Cons:3M, which comes from M M M, stands for ""Meetings, Meetings, and More Meetings"". Hence 3 M's. Every day passes with at least a meeting or three - pun intended! There are so many policies to work around, that it becomes sometimes impossible to accomplish a job in a given time frame, or worse, a project that may have required 1 month, takes 6 months to a year to complete. This slows down the momentum. The fact is that this is how ALL 3M businesses operate; it is not only a certain group, but from Operations, to R&D, to Engineering... One other downside, if you don't like to work for a ""big company"", then 3M is a BIG COMPANY spread around the world. Advice to Management:Senior Management need not any advice from the likes of us. They live to better the company every day. However, they should pay attention to what goes on in the details of everyones everyday job to make sure that policies they put in place are in the works.",5,2008-10-17T00:00:00.000Z,101819
Fun place to work,"Software Validation Engineer in Methuen, MA",Pros:Fun work environment. Not too many deadlines. Cons:Low pay in comparison to others. Advice to Management:Better communication to employees about company vision and direction.,5,2008-10-09T00:00:00.000Z,97231
"Not the ""old 3M""","Safety Specialist in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Decent career opportunities. My boss lets me think freely without hovering. I have a flexible schedule and am allowed to do my job with little to no micromanagement. Nice benefits. Many opportunities available throughout the country and world. I have lived in different parts of the country all while working for 3M, and have enjoyed most all of it. Cons:Bureaucratic policies and lots of red tape - no pun intended. It's not the same company I started working for right out of college, for sure. Policies exist for every little thing - working and making decisions should not have to be this difficult or cumbersome. Advice to Management:Cut the tape and do what makes sense because it makes sense, not because there's a policy surrounding it.",4,2008-09-16T00:00:00.000Z,81300
An innovation engine that has lost its way,Manufacturing Engineer,Pros:Good benefits package. The technologies are interesting and there is great potential to combine 3M technologies to create new products and markets. Cons:There is a undervaluation of technical expertise at 3M. People who spend an inordinate portion of their time making Powerpoint presentations for upper management advance and those who make massive technical contributions see their careers stagnate. 3M management lets the tail wag the dog in pushing the quality initiative de jour so pervasively that it greatly impedes progress and development. The company reacts to change at a glacial pace and fails to react quickly when markets change. They empire build and then resort to layoffs and write-offs once the tide changes and they've missed the boat. Advice to Management:3M senior management needs to restore the culture of innovation and invention what was squeezed out under Jim McNerney and George Buckley. The company has increasingly turned to layoffs and cutbacks to solve its short term financial shortcomings and has made significant cutbacks in the development pipeline that would have traditionally generated new sales and profits.,4,2008-09-03T00:00:00.000Z,70819
Great company from the bottom up. Vision and decision making at top are often at conflict.,Plant Manager,"Pros:Co-workers across the company are a great asset and willing to help others even those in different divisions or business groups. If you are willing to relocate, there opportunities are there for your taking. Cons:Typical large company bureacracy. Decisions are slow to come by and often too late to meet the market demands. Need to give middle managers the ability to make higher level decisions and then be accountable for them. Advice to Management:Be clear with your vision and then act on it. Goal of global growth is great, but you're short changing your staff by not giving them the resources to achieve it.",4,2008-09-02T00:00:00.000Z,70384
Standard big company cookie cutter carrier.,"Engineer in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Great people to work with, many smart scientists and engineers from all disciplines available for advice and collaboration. Many exciting technical areas of work. When the job reqs arent frozen, if unsatisfied at one place one would be able to switch jobs to a completly different area without having to leave the company (keeping all the benefits and vacations). Cons:This might be true for any large company, but it is really hard to stand out for a raise. The promotions/raise system is set up in such a way to keep everyone below industry median pay at all times. Not very competative. Little reward for doing an awesome job or 'performing at a much higher level'. It's like communism, everyone is the same, which rewards lazy people and chases away great workers that are willing to fight and take risks (what 3M needs most now). It used to be that 3M paid their employees less but offered more intangible benefits like a secure job, flexible hours and a more freedom for research. These benefits are gone, and the pay stays low. Advice to Management:Stop hiring senior managers and higer ups and stop laying off technicians! Many groups are getting extremly top heavy. We need more entry level engineers and technicians. We need grunts to actually do all the work the Senior Management has been ideating. Value needs to shift to skillsets again and away from talking and filling out excel templates or this company will fail in the next ten years.",2,2008-08-20T00:00:00.000Z,61120
3M is struggling,Marketing,"Pros:Opportunities to work in many different industries. Brilliant, creative technical people. Solid work ethic. Healthy team atmosphere. Cons:Lack of a longer term vision at all levels. The most dedicated employees have lost confidence in the company. The best and brightest are leaving us. It's going to be a painful recovery. Advice to Management:Figure out what you want the company to be and set a vision. If our historical brand of innovation by creative, dedicated employees is not not what will carry us into the future, what's is it?",3,2008-08-19T00:00:00.000Z,59197
Typical large company,"Sales Representative in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Lots of career opportunity, many people have had 10 or more unrelated jobs within the company Cons:Good old boy mentality, it appears that if daddy worked here you are definately more likely to get promoted faster..... I guess this holds true in a lot of Fortune 500 companies Advice to Management:Continue to invest in R+D and acquisitions, expectations of major growth are ridiculous with decades old technology, VHB can't do it on its own",3,2008-08-17T00:00:00.000Z,58391
Good company with room to improve.,"Supply Chain Analyst in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:3M offers decent pay and benefits. If you are a good performer they typically reward you with promotions and/or larger than average raises. They are willing to let you try and find better ways of doing things...but actually implementing them can be a different story. Cons:Beauracracy. Layoffs seem to target workers, not managers, especially in IT. It seems as though valuable IT resources are lost frequently, while the managers they reported to maintain their position without taking over the past responsibilities. The pace of change crawls, especially for IT systems. Some of the systems we have to use seem to have been modern in1975. Advice to Management:Continue to push modernization of the company. Streamline corporate and Big B groups so they serve their end users better.",4,2008-08-16T00:00:00.000Z,58083
3M - a company of followers and suck-ups,"Sourcing in Maplewood, MN","Pros:Pay and Benefits. Stable company. Cons:Very poor Management - immature, male dominated (look at our corporate org chart). Management needs constant approval. They do not encourage thinking outside the box. Advice to Management:Ask yourselves if you want people who only work hard. 3M loves someone who will work 60 hours even if what they are doing has no value. You need to encourage smart workers, even if it isn't your idea.",2,2008-08-04T00:00:00.000Z,51310
"Big dumb corporation believes it's own headlines, but forgets where the rubber meets the road.","Engineer in Irvine, CA","Pros:Steady work with reasonable benefits and pay. The working pace is amenable to people who seek a ""life balance"" and don't wish to be slaves to the job. In general the managers are human beings and really seek to have the least amount of day to day complications. The work place is pretty diverse in terms of people and almost any lifestyle is acceptable as long as you show up when you are supposed to and try to accomplish something. Flexible working hours are accepted. Being in Health Care instead of some of the other 3M businesses is a huge plus. Health Care is very profitable, how is life making sand paper or roofing granules? I frankly don't want to know. Cons:Big dumb corporation that kills innovation (yes at the vaunted 3M) and mans the red tape cannons at the first sign of a change. Continuing push towards moving production to cheap labor sources OUS leaves job security wanting. In terms of being part of the big 3M (3M Corp.) health care often gets treated to policies and procedures better focused on sand paper and roofing granules.

"Diverse company, many career options, strangled by red tape","Human Resources in Saint Paul, MN",Pros:Diverse company with diverse career opportunities Cons:Bureaucracies. Inward focus.

3M Big Profits small Salaries,"Accounts Payables - Front Line in Austin, TX","Pros:Good Building, relaxed atmoshpere. Cheap Gym on site. Flexible working hours. Huge company means larger chance of career progression as opposed to smaller firms. Cons:Very poor rates of pay compared to other companies in area. Keeping employees on temporary contract for years causes anxiety and doesn't makes good hardworking employees look elswhere for employment. Training given is bad and poorly organised. Advice to Management:Stop being over cautious on head counts and give the ""So called"" temporary staff permanent contracts. Pay us what we're worth.",2,2008-06-19T00:00:00.000Z,27983

Your manager might not even have the same background (i.e. if you’re in supply chain your manager could be a chemical engineer and knows literally nothing about your field and has no good advice on projects but will yell at you to figure it out without offering any productive advice).

Pay is low compared to other top device companies despite them telling you otherwise &amp; the many surveys they send out to the field are just smoke &amp; mirrors. It is sad because the people that work here love what they do, including myself. Unfortunately, 3M does not seem to care that reps are having to wear many hats. Don’t even get me started on the ridiculous quotas this year.
Advice to Management:Loosen up &amp; stop micromanaging. Let the reps do what they do best, sell/educate. Restructure how CSR’s are working orders and bring them back in-house, minimize the territory for the inside sales team so they have time to actually get things done. Listen to the feedback you get from reps &amp; customers. These are not complaints, this is feedback. 3M has so much room for improvement. A lot of people will stick around in the hopes that it will get better soon but if it does not people will leave.",2,2022-05-03T00:00:00.000Z,63585728
Culture needs updating,Engineer,"Pros:Brand recognition, good salary&amp; stable company
Cons:There are two cultures happening. The first, is initiatives put forth by corporate of how the culture should be. I see this happening between colleagues, but not within the reporting structures. 

The second is the actual culture. It is dictated by 3Mers 20 year +. If you’re a new 3Mer, find one of these colleagues. Otherwise you’ll step over invisible lines that you’re not supposed to cross. So much of it is unspoken and you should just “know.” 

Unfortunately, all I’ve seen with Management is rude pettiness. So many do not have the skills to be a good leader. They are very rude to anyone beneath them. In general, the culture feels like it’s stuck in the 80’s. 

Finally, I have never seen so much power given to one Manager. If your Manager is not prepared to manage people, your professional life will suffer. HR can only “advise” them. Legal can only “advise” them. It’s insanity, and I’ve never seen that at any other organization:
Advice to Management:Take a good hard look at your culture created by tenured employees. It certainly is not helping all the new external talent that is entering 3M. 

Have our CEO care more about employees and less about shareholders. That’s for the CFO to worry about.",2,2022-04-30T00:00:00.000Z,63476748

Not a place for New Employees,Marketing Manager,"Pros:Larger company and nice people
Cons:As a new employee I have been given no training and feel like I should have stayed at my old company. The business goals are not realistic and the financial pressure is all consuming. Also everyone I work with has been at the company over 20 years and reminds me that every time I bring up an opposing point of view. They say they want new external points of view but they really don’t. Again really regret my decision and a few thousand extra in base pay is not worth hating your job. I will be looking for new opportunities and returning to previous employer.
Advice to Management:If you hire new employees you have to train them. Make the culture easy to break into and stop telling new employees tenure is a metric that wins when debate is happening.",2,2022-02-16T00:00:00.000Z,59780087

Cons:Software engineers seemed to me to be ""indentured servants as almost all were on H1B Visas (China) and had a poor command of English so they were beholden to the company and at its whims. Non-Chinese programmers, what few there were, were discriminated against. They kind of kick people in the teeth after they've been quite loyal. Family business (before it got bought). Legacy product has an extremely disorganized user interface; not well thought out; endless add-ons and a strange color scheme (pink and green.) Overall the software dev process was extremely disorganized. the whole process or lack thereof was disorganized. Often put very junior people in positions they did not belong in as though they posed less of a threat and were therefore more palatable for management.

3M India is quite unprofessional and unethical as far as its treatment to employees are concerned,Anonymous Employee,"Pros:Nothing in particular. Its a sleepy organization which will offer you decent work life balance with no desire to improve
Cons:It only rewards loyalty and most of the senior managers are old 3Mers who have only seen 3M and are completely unaware of whats happening outside the world. They invariably will favour their old employees over new ones for only one reason i.e. loyalty even if they do not have any talent or desire to improve the 3M process. I think worst is 3M supply chain which is headed by an old timer who would go to any length to ensure metrics look good even though its wrong or fudged. Completely unethical. This is one of the reason very few lateral hires stay beyond 1-2 years in 3M supply chain.i

Change is the constant,"Anonymous Employee in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Diverse product portfolios and business groups lead to a breadth of business opportunities that could allow someone to spend their entire career with one company while presenting them with experiences in a variety of markets (Consumer, Safety, Industrial, Electronics, etc.). Core Benefits are solid (Medical, Dental, Vision, etc.), but don't expect any cool perks you might find at SaaS or Consulting companies (Sports tickets, unlimited PTO, free branded merchandise/swag, networking events, Presidents club, consistent sales incentive trips). Cons:3M has a growth problem due to its internal complexities leading to often times a poor customer experience, an indirect model that makes it difficult to measure end-user sales impact and lack of product innovation which results in pushing antiquated technology/product platforms in the market at a premium price in comparison with competition. In addition to the growth problems, multiple lawsuits loom over the company. From a sales standpoint, the variable compensation system in the U.S. is too complex. Managers and Reps are often times unable to explain it, which is a problem. Additionally, sales organizations are antiquated about their go to market strategies and how to best deploy coverage models within target markets compared to modern sales organizations traditionally found in the SaaS space with clearly delineated roles and responsibilities (BDR/SDR, AE, Sales Engineer, Customer Success, etc.).

Benefits have slowly been eroded over the years. Employees are stuck using antiquated software and systems to do basic daily tasks, which kills productivity and require technical support frequently. Advice to Management:""As our business grows, it becomes increasingly necessary to delegate responsibility and to encourage men and women to exercise their initiative. This requires considerable tolerance. Those men and women, to whom we delegate authority and responsibility, if they are good people, are going to want to do their jobs in their own way. Mistakes will be made. But if a person is essentially right, the mistakes he or she makes are not as serious in the long run as the mistakes management will make if it undertakes to tell those in authority exactly how they must do their jobs. Management that is destructively critical when mistakes are made kills initiative. And it’s essential that we have many people with initiative if we are to continue to grow.

3M Needs Help,Engineering Specialist,"Pros:- The pay is decent. - Many production employees are smart and kind. They make the job worthwhile. - The work itself is easy. The challenging part is navigating the stubborn, lazy, or those who simply do not care (why do they work here?). Cons:- Quality has taken a back seat to speed. - Lower and middle management are not held accountable for shipping poor product, nor ensuring operators are trained properly and with consistency (contrary to the perception from upper management). - The strongest production employees are not usually selected for development and advancement. Same goes for salaried into management roles. Advice to Management:Why would you eliminate the position of any employee who, through their innovation and execution, has been able to save the company $2-5MM each year for several years? Why would you not promote or offer them a different position? For upper management, realize when disconnected decision-making is taking place amongst your organization. Get to know the people in your organization. You would be foolish to limit your level of communication to your direct reports, while expecting the whole truth and nothing but. You'll find better options are available, when making your selections to invest in employees for development and management roles.",2,2023-06-26T00:00:00.000Z,77738698

Lack of commitment to intiatives and employees,"Supply Chain Manager in Saint Paul, MN","Pros:Excellent colleagues. 3M historically has attracted top talent early in their career and developed people from within. As a result, you find yourself surrounded with excellent and knowledgeable people who know how to get things done in the company and are committed to their roles. Cons:3M's top leadership and BOD's commitment to their strategy, initiatives, and people has suffered greatly since about 2015. The company has fallen on hard times financially and has replaced much of its highly talented leadership with outsiders who do not understand how to make the company successful. They have come to rely on consultants to come in and sell them a bill of goods on what needs to be done only to discover that the recommendations are infeasible to actually carry out within the time and budget allocated. Instead of retooling and working it out, leadership rather conducts yet another reorganization and lays off thousands of good and talented people. They've lost the reigns and do not know how to operate a large, diversified company whose strong suit of product and technology innnovations has been lost. Very sad to see a previously great company falter as 3M has. Advice to Management:Return to your roots of innovative product development to get that pipeline opened back up, promote your top talent into important roles and rely on them to get the company back on course, stop hiring consulting firms that misguide your decision making, develop your strategic plans and stick to them. Work through the hard things instead of abandoning them and stop with the constant reorganizations.",3,2023-06-28T00:00:00.000Z,77807320

Tough place to work currently.,"Data Deployment Lead in Maplewood, MN",Pros:Some of the best people I have worked with are or were employed by 3M. Plenty of opportunity to learn how to change direction on the fly. Cons:Plenty of opportunity to learn how to change direction on the fly. To the point it felt like the project(s) were rudderless much of the time. The great leaders and employees were often ignored when presenting hard truths about project decisions that would end up costing time and plenty of money. Due to laying people off each year for the last 6 years it is hard to trust the executive leadership strategy. It has also caused significantly more work for those that are left after they lay offs. To be transparent I was laid off in the May 2023 layoff but I have honestly been more concerned for those that were left and had to continue to pick up even more work with less people on unrealistic deadlines. It is hard to watch a company that has played such a major role in the economy of the state I have called home my entire life but there are some serious problems right now starting at the top and due to that I would caution anyone from accepting a job offer from 3M. Advice to Management:Stop thinking you are smarter than the collective whole. You have hired some very smart people who can help you from running head first into problems. And yes that might mean you have to put your ego aside and listen to even the lowest job grades (boots on the ground) significantly more.,2,2023-08-21T00:00:00.000Z,79335187

A Grand 20th Century Company with a Trajectory of Decay in the 21st Century,Key Account Manager (KAM),"Pros:1. Strong global industrial brand and market volume. 2. Sophisticated Risk-Management and U.S. tax-advantaged policies with an indirect benefit of secure and safe employment during pandemics. 3. Accessibility to a global library of Best Business Practices and methodology. 4. High attrition rate of top performers and disgruntled employees affords advancement opportunities for a younger generation and friends of upper management. 5. A great place to 9-to-5 towards retirement... if that's your thing. Cons:1. Clunky behemoth with weak transformation to digital-age opportunity capture. 2. Fluffy organizational management poor at Better Business Practices and continuous improvement. 3. A trickle-down lack of genuine accountability means declining corporate value to loyal employees and consumer relations. 4. A short-term company for long-term career impact. Support and progress are too slow for merit-based performance. Advice to Management:I get it... the damage is already done. Overdue industrial-age lawsuits in the military, healthcare, and environmental spaces plus lagging pivot to post-pandemic supply chain resilience and information-age transformation all underscore the short-term quarterly decisions of a large public company. So, we can't completely blame senior management (notice I didn't use the word ""leadership""). However, we can remind ourselves that an unyielding focus on the consumer should supersede the organizational default to produce more... more manufactured products, more marketing collateral, more vapid human resource management, more wasteful meetings all irrelevant to consumer needs and employee purpose. An evolution to authentic leadership with confident humility, active customer engagement, and an accountable approach to talent development may serve 3M and SpinCo well and consumers even better. But be warned, it will take more than a quarter to transform coal into diamonds. Have a nice day!",3,2023-07-22T00:00:00.000Z,78483266
3M,"Supply Chain Manager in Saint Paul, MN",Pros:Talented employees who embrace collaboration and innovation.

Financial engineering has taken priority over fundamentals. 3M values are expected from employees but not followed by the executives who appear to have lost their moral and ethical compass. Advice to Management:The 3M board should fire the CEO Mike Roman who restructured 3M multiple times over several years unsuccessfully. Key engineering and Lean six sigma factory talent has been lost and will lead long term decline of organization. Digital transformation not a priority contrary to the current trends with other companies. He has brought in outside help to make up for his incompetence.

Secondly, moral was low the entire year of 2023 due to waves of layoffs and the updates with the PFAS litigations. The culture was starting to get toxic for a while there, where multiple leaders I knew left and jumped ship to other companies. They likely were seeing the writing on the wall. To top it all off, the investors are seeing this and it has been reflected in 3M's stock market value. Advice to Management:Nothing for management. I think Mike Roman and the C-Suite, along with Jeff Lavers and MSD executive leadership are making the tough calls that have to be made.

toxic work environment,"Advanced Laboratory Technician in Maplewood, MN","Pros:sick time and schedule flexibility Cons:pretty much everything else besides what I wrote in pros. - very cut throat and back-stabby work environment. do not trust your co-workers here, atleast the ones that I have in my group are this way. - it is not worth working hard or going above and beyond because you will get the same performance review grade as someone who comes into work and does the bare minimum. Hard work is only rewarded by more work and responsibilities with out a pay raise or promotion - impossible to get a promotion if your supervisor/management has any personal issues with you, despite if your performance and regular job duties go above and beyond your current job grade. You are expected to work at the level above your pay grade to ""prove"" you are capable, when even when you do this, the goal posts keep getting moved. Promotions from group to group vary so widely, there is no standardized approach to promotions which lead to rampant nepotism. - HR is only there to protect the company and management. It doesn't matter if your management violated the code of conduct and you provided proof that this was happening. You stick your neck out to do the right thing, and then when HR does nothing, you then have a huge target on your back from your management who then continues to undermine you in more covert ways. And then HR ignores when you are targeted for retaliation. - morale is terrible and will only continue to get worse. Unless there are huge changes within 3M within the next 6 months (and not just ""restructuring"" lay-offs that seem to have no rhyme or reason), I do not see how this will get any better. - psychologically an unsafe place to work. abuse and bullying from management is tolerated. HR will do nothing. - if you care about your mental health or job security, steer clear of this company. Advice to Management:there needs to be accountability in management. Supervisors, managers, directors, VPs, etc are all apparently untouchable and do not get any feedback from direct reports on how well they do their jobs. I have seen completely incompetent supervisors get promoted, only because they are able to pool the wool over the eyes of their management above them and take credit for the work of others. I think 3M needs a complete gutting and rebuild from the inside as it is completely rotten",1,2023-12-29T00:00:00.000Z,82914534
