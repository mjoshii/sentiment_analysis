# sentiment_analysis using VADER and TEXTBLOB

A sample dataset with feedback from users is used to evaluate the sentiment or emotion for a hypothetical company and classify that emotion as positive, negative or neutral using python libraries like VADER and TEXTBLOB.

The results indicate that there are differences between the results from VADER and TEXTBLOB.

Updates will be made to this repo in due course based on further analysis.
