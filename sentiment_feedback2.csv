As a scientist  working at 3M is like being a kid living in a toy store. It's a wonderful feeling being a part of world-class innovation. I absolutely love the work I do  and it's a real thrill to develop exciting products alongside other passionate scientists and engineers. Cons:Unfortunately  3M seems to have some major faults  especially in today's sociopolitical climate. It's hard to write this  but it's important to share. From my point of view as a scientist and product developer  3M seems to care more about its shareholders and its managers than it does about the people inventing and manufacturing the products that make our company relevant. This is a sad situation and I think 3M can do better. The first step is acknowledging some of its many serious missteps: 3M cut jobs and salaries during the pandemic  but somehow had plenty of cash to pay out as dividends to rich investors on Wall Street. This makes very little sense from an organizational health perspective. And it makes even less sense from a social justice perspective where income inequality is such a strong forced for much of the negativity we see in the US right now. Furthermore  3M promotes and rewards managers who lay off productive and valuable workers with no regard for the pandemic-rattled job market. Leadership would do better by 3M to adopt a Stakeholder Mindset. 3M claims to be an inclusive company committed to sustainability and equality  but continues to reward career sharks who stifle truly sustainable innovation and the diverse people who drive that innovation. 3M cancels programs and stifles innovations that offer true sustainability (even ones with objectively excellent profitability) in favor of gratuitously high and unsustainable profit margins. 3M further rewards the same lock-step managers who feed this toxic culture  and stifles the careers of those who try to make a positive impact to our global society. As a scientist and global citizen  it is incredibly hard to see this happening at such an ostensibly progressive company like 3M. While 3M is truly excellent at charitable donations around the world  there are serious internal problems with diversity and inclusion. I applaud 3M's philanthropy  and hope to see improvements in culture internally. For example  while we do have quite a few underrepresented groups in leadership roles  many of these people have the same career shark mentality that prevents the people they're representing in their demographic from thriving and attaining similar success. Now  this message board ensures that ""each employer has the right to respond to a review left by a member for free  and that the employer be given the last word on a review."" I enthusiastically invite a response to this thoughtful review - with the counterargument that our planet  3M's employees and customers  and humanity's global society always have the last word. 3M needs to do better. The good news is that we can do better. We have many excellent people. We just need to have the right people in leadership roles. Suggestions are provided below. Advice to Management:1. We need a flatter organization where toxic leadership has nowhere to hide. 2a. We have too much turnover in middle management  to the point that the people running important businesses and laboratories simply don't understand the businesses or labs they are running. Self-promoting behavior and short-sighted decisions leading to poor growth and lack of morale are the long-lasting consequences of this. 2b. If we continue allowing this kind of turnover in leadership  then we need our leaders to have a transparent and traceable track record of successes and failures to discourage myopic and unsustainable business strategies. 3. Our people need a clear and measurable path to success - not an opaque machination wherein director-level leaders determine the success or failure of their employees' careers on personal whim. 4. We need an HR organization that works to make 3M's systems benefit everyone's career  not just the managers. 5. Finally  we need to take innovation seriously. Class 4+ innovation requires consistent financial commitment  organizational alignment  championing  and most importantly rewards and career advancement for the hard-working people who advance those innovations. Class 4+ innovation does not always lead to commercialized products. But the IP and internal knowledge generated in the process is still valuable - and it needs to be rewarded if 3M wants its strong community of scientists and engineers to take intelligent risks at high-growth-potential Class 4+ programs. 6. Stop buying back shares of stock. This is completely antithetical to organic growth. Instead  invest money in employees' careers  in R&amp;D  in go-to-market strategies  and in strategic acquisitions. 7. Tie raises and Annual Incentive Pay (called bonuses in other companies) to dividend dispersals. If 3M can afford to pay cash to investors  then 3M can properly reward the hard-working people who created that value in the first place.","Pros:3M is an amazingly innovative company.

My particular manager seemed to never be there  so working flex hours was not an issue  but can't speak to other teams. The work load was not too extensive for me  but that may have been due to the in-fighting across teams that allowed very little to get assigned and done. They had a decent web mail client  which  given managers' propensity to answer and send all emails after 8pm was a life saver. Cons:I would not know where to start here. Most employees have been there for 10-20+ years  so this particular division did not take kindly to outsiders. The in-fighting between teams was so extensive that I was given a list of people to ""not respond to via email or phone."" I was also told not to attend meetings without approval from my manager to ensure my expertise was not ""stolen"" by ""the enemy."" Yuck. I was closed off from projects I offered the most seasoned expertise in  due to senior leadership very much disliking each other. It was disappointing to not get to leverage my expertise in an arena that so badly needed it  and the constant back-stabbing and bad-mouthing of co-workers that started on day one and never stopped made me very uncomfortable. Also  I was constantly asked to tap my network of digital vendors  agencies and resources to produce RFPs or work for 3M at the 11th hour that never went anywhere. Great way to ruin long-standing working relationships outside of the company. I was not aware of anyone who seemed ""happy"" working there compared to other companies I have worked for. No one smiled  ever. I finally had to start working on projects without telling my manager just to ensure I was doing anything at all and that I was helping them from spending way too much for way too little or just simply doing something not aligned with their audience/customer needs. From a sheer ""company"" perspective  the oddities at 3M Healthcare were endless. There were no refrigerators for employees to store lunch  beverages  etc. It may not sound like a big deal - try it sometime. The lunchroom was open very briefly every day  and offered the worst  most unhealthy and expensive selection of food (if you got there in time to get any) I have ever seen  anywhere. To avoid waste  they provided less food than needed  and anything edible was gone immediately. There's nothing but fast food around there  so going off-site was not a better option. I spent my first three days literally sitting in an empty cube with no computer (which can be typical) but also with nothing to read  ramp-up on  or anyone coming by to say hello or get me situated  manager included. I had to train myself on all systems and getting logins to do so was far more frustrating and time-consuming than usual. The commute is horrid  too  unless you live out that way. There was no discernible process to anything  and trying to instill any was futile. I had to ask folks many times for things they'd promised to deliver  to little avail. I never really knew what I was supposed to be working on  what would come up as ""due"" at any time  or what would be summarily cancelled or taken off my plate - all of this was due to politics. I spent more time in meetings about projects that never moved forward (or that at least our team was ""kicked off of"") than in meetings about viable projects. I attempted to address all of these issues over and over  to no result  and ended up having to print and save the nasty emails between teams their managers to ensure I was never ""blamed"" for something I was not involved in. Not fun. It might be fine for folks that have been there forever  and other divisions may be more advanced in their collaboration and politicking skills not to mention digital savvy. I didn't stay long enough to find out. I actually saw one person start and quit within a week while I was there. If you offer valuable expertise and have worked for other companies be ready for a massive culture shock. Advice to Management:Play nicely  and serve the customer  not your egos  infighting or chest-beating. Leverage expertise that you did not previously have internally when it is offered to you. Stop talking badly about other managers to their team members  and do not slight their team members or discount their expertise due to your own upper-level politics. Plan  and then follow through. Work smart  not hard  and use the proper vendors/agencies for what you are trying to accomplish  rather than agencies you are ""friends with"" who may not have the skills needed to do the job. If you are going to swear and talk badly of others  close your office door. Sitting outside your office and hearing it all day is not fun and quickly lowers morale. DOn't spend a team status meeting taklking badly of other teams/managers. Realize that a nice mix of 3M-seasoned managers  and managers from other companies is a GOOD thing  not a competition.","Pros:If you are coming in to 3M with previous digital expertise  you will notice immediately the need to educate your peers  which can be a good thing  and can become taxing.

Excellent salary. 3M really stepped up during COVID by sending all employees a COVID care package which included cloth masks (10)  anti-bacterial sanitizer  and a zero-touch door opening tool. Zero on-call responsibility. The offerings for people that were affected by the (still ongoing) reduction in force (RIF) were better than I have seen elsewhere. Everything from coaching  expert consultants  access to job fairs  etc. It was by far the most well executed and organized RIF - maybe this is a negative? Cons:I have never seen a company spend so much time  effort  and money on all the stuff they physically mail. All of the content was simply  �look how awesome everything is at 3M; you are valued� and had zero value other than to the people who were picked to pose in the articles. God help you if you want to make positive change. It is like the mob - they will whack you  your family  and your pets. You are good if you are okay with the �this is the way we�ve always done it� mentality. By far the most political environment in which I have ever worked. Everything is a favor and not �just do your job�. 3M is way too big for an individual contributor to matter. Everyone starts out shiny  hopeful  and wanting to help out your fellow 3M�rs but after a few months that all changes to frustration  anger  and despair. You are  quite literally  an employee number  an expense  and a line item on a spreadsheet. If you think you matter  I promise you that you do not. If you think you are part of a larger purpose or mission  I promise you that you are not. If you think your contributions have made a difference  I promise you that someone else took the credit for it instead of you (but you will never know). Management would let people go and you wouldn�t find out until you attempted to reach out to them and never got a response. When you finally get fed up with the lack of response and reach out to their manager  you are finally told that they are no longer with the company. When asked who their replacement is for XYZ function you are told that there is no one and there will be no backfill because there is a constant hiring freeze. Huh? I had absolutely zero 3M-funded training during employment. Whenever management was asked about funds for XYZ training  employees were given the runaround and eventually would stop asking altogether. For the first time in my IT career  I paid for my own training  event fees  and certification costs. This is a standard benefit afforded to almost any IT professional by a company (unless you work at 3M). I saved this for last. If you feel that this is inaccurate  please read some news articles before considering employment. Google �13-million-3m-earplug-verdict� to get a nicely summarized summary. Shady business practices and tactics. 3M touted itself as a company �based on ethics� - I am sure that ethics exist somewhere at 3M but I don�t consider screwing veterans and other responders out of settlement money by splitting a company into two  where one is profitable (new healthcare company) and the other not so profitable (PostIt notes  Meguiars  Nexcare  and everything else) with the intent to bankrupt the legacy 3M hoping to subvert paying what is rightfully owed. Additionally  I don�t think it was very ethical to invoke a huge reduction in force (which is still on-going) just a day or two after the judge called BS on that plan. After the reduction in force was enacted  and then applying for jobs  I quickly realized that my time at 3M had actually crippled my career because everything was so massively siloed that you didn�t have the ability to grow much less get anything done effectively or in a timely manner; but you stayed because the pay is awesome and benefits were great. You lose a bit of your soul in exchange for benefits  pay  and flexibility; believe me  it isn�t worth it to put the 3M name on your resume.
